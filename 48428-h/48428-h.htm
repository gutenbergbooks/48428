<p>This is the last record by sound ranging of artillery activity on the American front near the River Moselle. It is the reproduction of a piece of recording tape
as it issued from an American sound-ranging apparatus when the hour of 11 o'clock on the morning of November 11, 1918, brought the general order to
cease firing, and the great war came to an end. Six seconds of sound recording are shown. The broken character of the records on the left indicates great
artillery activity; the lack of irregularities on the right indicates almost complete cessation of firing, two breaks in the second line probably being due
to the exuberance of a doughboy firing his pistol twice close to one of the recording microphones on the front in celebration of the dawn of peace. The two
minutes on either side of the exact armistice hour have been cut from the strip to emphasize the contrast. Sound ranging was an important means of locating
the positions and calibers of enemy guns. A description of these wonderful devices, which were a secret with America and the Allies, is given in Book
III, chapter 4.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Crowell</span>: American munitions production, which for
some time has been in your charge, played an important part in the
early decision of the war, yet the very immensity and complexity
of the problem has made it difficult for this accomplishment to be
adequately understood by the public or in fact by any except those
who have had occasion to give the matter special study. As the
whole people have been called upon to make sacrifices for the war,
all the people should be given an opportunity to know what has been
done in their behalf in munitions production, and I therefore ask
that you have prepared a historical statement of munitions production,
so brief that all may have time to read it, so nontechnical that
all may be able readily to understand it, and so authoritative that
all may rely upon its accuracy.</p>

Cordially yours,<br />

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Except in one or two instances, this account of the production of
munitions in America for the war against Germany and her allies
contains nothing about secret devices invented during the period
under discussion. When the necessity for silence with respect to
vital matters brought about a voluntary censorship in American
publications, the land was filled with rumors of new and revolutionary
developments in war mat&eacute;riel, particularly of new weapons of offense.
It is fair to the American public to-day to state that such rumors were
not without foundation. American inventiveness rose splendidly
to the emergency. The expected American offensive in 1919 would
have had its "surprises" in numbers, some of which might well have
proved to be decisive. Certain of these inventions had been put in
large production before the armistice was declared, others had been
carried to an advanced experimental stage that insured their success.
Since the value of these innovations as part of the Nation's permanent
military assets depends largely upon their secret nature, it would be
obviously unwise to mention or describe them at this time.</p>

<p>The Director of Munitions wishes to acknowledge the debt of
America, so far as the production of munitions is concerned, to the
Navy for its cooperation in industrial matters at home and its strong
aid in the safe transport of munitions to France, and to all the other
Government departments, each one of which contributed in numerous
and important ways to the success of the munitions enterprise. The
debt also extends heavily to the War Industries Board, its functions
of creating facilities for manufacture, opening up new sources of raw
materials, allocating materials, decreeing priorities, fixing prices, and
acting as purchasing agent for the allies, making it the national
industrial clearing house through which the War Department could
work without waste effort. Acknowledgment is made to such essential
agencies as the United States Railroad Administration, the
United States Fuel Administration, the War Trade Board, and the
United States Food Administration, and to all official or volunteer
activities looking to the conservation and mobilization of our national
resources. Without this entire cooperation the history set forth in
these pages would not be what it is.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>As our war against Germany recedes into the past its temporal
boundaries become more sharply defined, and it assumes the character
of a complete entity&mdash;a rounded-out period of time in which
the United States collected her men and resources, fought, and shared
in the victory.</p>

<p>As such it offers to the critic the easy opportunity to discover
that certain things were not done. American airplanes did not
arrive at the front in sufficient numbers. American guns in certain
essential calibers did not appear at all. American gas shells were
not fired at the enemy. American troops fought with French and
British machine guns to a large extent. The public is familiar with
such statements.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the war up to its last few weeks&mdash;up
to its last few days, in fact&mdash;was a period of anxious suspense,
during which America was straining her energies toward a goal,
toward the realization of an ambition which, in the production of
munitions, dropped the year 1918 almost out of consideration altogether,
which indeed did not bring the full weight of American men
and mat&eacute;riel into the struggle even in 1919, but which left it for
1920, if the enemy had not yet succumbed to the growing American
power, to witness the maximum strength of the United States in the
field.</p>

<p>Necessarily, therefore, the actual period of hostilities, between
April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, was devoted in this country
to laying down the foundations of a munitions industry that should
bring about its overwhelming results at the appointed time. What
munitions of the more difficult sort were actually produced in this
period might almost be termed casual to the main enterprise&mdash;pilots
of the quantities to come.</p>

<p>The decision to prepare heavily for 1919 and 1920 and thus sacrifice
for 1917 and 1918 the munitions that might have been produced
at the cost of any less adequate preparation for the more distant
future, was based on sound strategical reasoning on the part of the
Allies and ourselves.</p>

<p>On going back to the past we find that on April 6, 1917, the United
States scarcely realized the gravity of the undertaking. There was
a general impression, reaching even into Government, that the Allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
alone were competent to defeat the Central Powers in time, and that
America's part would be largely one of moral support, with expanding
preparation in the background as insurance against any unforeseen
disasters. In line with this attitude we sent the first division
of American troops to France in the spring of 1917 to be our earnest
to the governments and peoples of the Allies that we were with them
in the great struggle. Not until after the departure of the various
foreign missions that came to this country during that spring did
America fully awake to the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>All through the summer of 1917 the emphasis upon American
man power in France gradually grew, but no definite schedule upon
which the United States could work was reached until autumn or
early winter, until the mission headed by Col. Edward M. House
visited Europe to give America place on the Supreme War Council
and in the Interallied Conference. The purpose of the House
mission was to assure the Allies that America was in the war for all
she was worth and to determine the most effective method in which
she could cooperate.</p>

<p>In the conferences in London and Paris the American representatives
looked into the minds of the allied leaders and saw the situation
as it was. Two dramatic factors colored all the discussions&mdash;the
growing need for men and the gravity of the shipping situation.
The German submarines were operating so effectively as to make
exceedingly dark the outlook for the transport on a sufficient scale
either of American troops or of American munitions.</p>

<p>As to man power, the Supreme War Council gave it as the judgment
of the military leaders of the Allies that, if the day were to be
saved, America must send 1,000,000 troops by the following July.
There were in France then (on Dec. 1, 1917) parts of four divisions
of American soldiers&mdash;129,000 men in all.</p>

<p>The program of American cooperation, as it crystallized in these
conferences, may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1. To keep the Allies from starvation by shipping food.</p>

<p>2. To assist the Allied armies by keeping up the flow of mat&eacute;riel
already in production for them in the United States.</p>

<p>3. To send as many men as could be transported with the shipping
facilities then at America's command.</p>

<p>4. To bend energies toward a big American Army in 1919 equipped
with American supplies.</p>

<p>In these conferences sat the chief military and political figures of
the principal European powers at war with Germany. In the Supreme
War Council were such strategists as Gen. Foch for the French and
Gen. Robertson for the British, Gen. Bliss representing the United
States. The president of the Interallied Conference was M. Clemenceau,
the French prime minister. Mr. Winston Churchill, the minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of munitions, represented Great Britain, while Mr. Lloyd-George,
the Prime Minister of England, also participated to some extent in
the conferences.</p>

<p>Out of bodies of such character came the international ordnance
agreement. It will be apparent to the reader that this agreement
must have represented the best opinion of the leaders of the principal
Allies, initiated out of their intimate knowledge of the needs of the
situation and concurred in by the representatives of the United
States. The substance of this agreement was outlined for Washington
in a cabled message signed by Gen. Bliss, a document that
had such an important bearing upon the production of munitions
in this country that its more important passages are set down at this
point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The representatives of Great Britain and France state that their production of
artillery (field, medium, and heavy) is now established on so large a scale that they are
able to equip completely all American divisions as they arrive in France during the
year 1918 with the best make of British and French guns and howitzers.</p>

<p>The British and French ammunition supply and reserves are sufficient to provide
the requirements of the American Army thus equipped at least up to June, 1918, provided
that the existing 6-inch shell plants in the United States and Dominion of
Canada are maintained in full activity, and provided that the manufacture of 6-inch
howitzer carriages in the United States is to some extent sufficiently developed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the French, and to a lesser extent the British, require as soon
as possible large supplies of propellants and high explosives: and the British require
the largest possible production of 6-inch howitzers from now onward and of 8-inch and
9.2-inch shell from June onward.</p>

<p>In both of these matters they ask the assistance of the Americans.</p>

<p>With a view, therefore, first to expedite and facilitate the equipment of the American
armies in France, and, second, to secure the maximum ultimate development of
the ammunition supply with the minimum strain upon available tonnage, the representatives
of Great Britain and France propose that the American field, medium, and heavy
artillery be supplied during 1918, and as long after as may be found convenient,
from British and French gun factories; and they ask: (A) That the American efforts
shall be immediately directed to the production of propellants and high explosives
on the largest possible scale; and (B) Great Britain also asks that the 6-inch, 8-inch, and
9.2-inch shell plants already created for the British service in the United States shall
be maintained in the highest activity, and that large additional plants for the manufacture
of these shells shall at once be laid down.</p>

<p>In this way alone can the tonnage difficulty be minimised and potential artillery
development, both in guns and shells, of the combined French, British, and American
armies be maintained in 1918 and still more in 1919.</p></div>

<p>This agreement had a profound effect upon American production
of munitions. Most important of all, it gave us time; time to build
manufacturing capacity on a grand scale without the hampering
necessity for immediate production; time to secure the best in design;
time to attain quality in the enormous output to come later as opposed
to early quantity of indifferent class.</p>

<p>In the late autumn of 1917, shortly after Russia collapsed and
withdrew from the war, it became evident that Germany would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
seize the opportunity to move her troops from the eastern front and
concentrate her entire army against the French and British in 1918.</p>

<p>This intelligence at once resulted in fresh emphasis upon the man-power
phase of American cooperation. As early as December, 1917,
the War Department was anticipating the extraordinary need for
men in the coming spring by considering plans for the transport of
troops up to the supposed limit of the capacity of all available
American ships, with what additional tonnage Great Britain and the
other Allies could spare us. It is of record that the actual dispatch
of troops to France far outstripped these early estimates.</p>

<p>Then came the long-expected German offensive, and the cry went
up in Europe for men. England, "her back against the wall,"
offered additional ships in which to transport six divisions over and
above the number of troops already scheduled for embarkation,
agreeing further to feed and maintain these men for 10 weeks while
they were brigaded with British units for final training. After the
six additional divisions had embarked there was still need of men,
and the British continued their transports in our service. The high
mark of shipment was in July, when 306,000 American soldiers were
transported across the Atlantic, more than three times the number
contemplated for July in the schedule adopted six months earlier.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of this stepping up of the man-power program upon the
shipment of supplies was described by Lieut. Col. Repington, the
British military critic, writing in the Morning Post (London) on
December 9, 1918, in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>* * * they (the British war cabinet) also prayed America in aid, implored her to
send in haste all available infantry and machine guns, and placed at her disposal, to
her great surprise, a large amount of transports to hasten arrivals. * * *</p>

<p>The American Government acceded to this request in the most loyal and generous
manner. Assured by their Allies in France that the latter could fit out the American
infantry divisions on their arrival with guns, horses, and transport, the Americans
packed their infantry tightly in the ships and left to a later occasion the dispatch to
France of guns, horses, transport, labor units, flying service, rolling stock, and a score
of other things originally destined for transport with the divisions. If subsequently&mdash;and
indeed up to the day that the armistice was signed&mdash;Gen. Pershing found himself
short of many indispensable things, and if his operations were thereby conducted under
real difficulties of which he must have been only too sensible, the defects were
not due to him and his staff, nor to the Washington administration, nor to the resolute
Gen. March and his able fellow workers, but solely to the self-sacrificing manner in
which America had responded to the call of her friends.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>BRITISH AND AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES ON WESTERN FRONT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The really amazing thing which America did was to place in
France in 19 months an army of the size and the ability of the American
Expeditionary Force. The war taught us that America can
organize, train, and transport troops of a superior sort at a rate which
leaves far behind any program for the manufacture of munitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
It upset the previous opinion that adequate military preparedness is
largely a question of trained man power.</p>

<p>When the war touched us our strategical equipment included plans
ready drawn for the mobilization of men. There were on file at the
Army War College in Washington detailed plans for defending our
harbors, our coasts, and our borders. There were also certain plans
for the training of new troops.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note, however, that this equipment included no
plan for the equally important and equally necessary mobilization
of industry and production of munitions, which proved to be the
most difficult phase of the actual preparation for war. The experience
of 1917 and 1918 was a lesson in the time it takes to determine
types, create designs, provide facilities, and establish manufacture.
These years will forever stand as the monument to the American
genius of workshop and factory, which in this period insured the
victory by insuring the timely arrival of the overwhelming force of
America's resources in the form of America's munitions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

THE ORDNANCE PROBLEM.</h3>


<p>To arm the manhood called to defend the Nation in 1917 and
1918, to make civilians into soldiers by giving them the tools of the
martial profession&mdash;such was the task of the Ordnance Department
in the late war.</p>

<p>The off-hand thought may identify ordnance as artillery alone.
It may surprise many to know that in the American ordnance
catalogue of supplies during the recent war there were over 100,000
separate and distinct items. Thousands of the items of ordnance
were distinctly noncommercial, meaning that they had to be designed
and produced specially for the uses of war.</p>

<p>While the principles of fighting essentially have changed not one
whit since the age when projectiles were stones hurled by catapults,
nearly every advance in mechanical science has had its reflection in
warfare, until to-day the weapons which man has devised to destroy
the military power of his enemy make up an intricate and an imposing
list. When America accepted the challenge of Germany in
1917, part of the range of ordnance had already been produced in
moderate quantities in the United States, part of it had been developed
by the more militaristic nations of the world in the last
decade or quarter century, and part of it was purely the offspring
of two and one-half years of desperate fighting before America
entered the great struggle. Yet all of it, both the strange and the
familiar, had to be put in production here on a grand scale and in
a minimum of time, that the American millions might go adequately
equipped to meet the foe. Let us examine the range of this equipment,
seeing in the major items something of the character of the
problem which confronted the Ordnance Department at the outset
of the great enterprise.</p>

<p>Starting with the artillery, there was first in order of size the baby
two-man cannon of 37 millimeters (about an inch and a half) in the
diameter of its bore&mdash;a European development new to our experience,
so light that it could be handled by foot troops in the field, used for
annihilating the enemy's machine-gun emplacements.</p>

<p>Then the mobile field guns&mdash;the famous 75's, the equivalent in
size of our former 3-inch gun, the 155-millimeter howitzer, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
French 155 millimeter G. P. F. (Grand Puissance Filloux) gun of
glorious record in the war, and its American prototypes, the 4.7-inch,
5-inch, and 6-inch guns&mdash;all of these employed to shell crossroads
and harass the enemy's middle area.</p>

<p>Beyond these were the 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers and the
terrific 240-millimeter howitzer, for throwing great weights of destruction
high in air to descend with a plunge upon the enemy's strongest
defenses.</p>

<p>Then there were the 8-inch, 10-inch, 12-inch, and 14-inch guns on
railway mounts, for pounding the depots and dumps in the enemy's
back areas. These weapons were so tremendous in weight when
mounted as to require from 16 to 24 axles on the car to distribute
the load and the recoil of firing within the limits of the strength of
standard heavy railway track.</p>

<p>All of these guns had to be produced in great numbers, if the
future requirements of the American forces were to be met, produced
by the thousands in the cases of the smaller ones and by the hundreds
and scores in the cases of the larger.</p>

<p>These weapons would be ineffective without adequate supplies of
ammunition. In the case of the mobile held guns this meant a
requirement of millions of shell or shrapnel for the incessant bombardments
and the concentrated barrages which characterized the
great war. The entire weight of projectiles fired in such an historic
engagement as Gettysburg would supply the artillery only for a few
minutes in such intensive bombardments as sowed the soil of
Flanders with steel.</p>

<p>The artillery demanded an immense amount of heavy equipment&mdash;limbers,
caissons, auto ammunition trucks, and tractors to drag the
heavy and middle-heavy artillery. Some of them were fitted with
self-propelled caterpillar mounts which could climb a 40&deg; grade or
make as high as 12 miles an hour on level ground. These, the
adaptations to warfare of peaceful farm and construction machine
traction, for the first time rendered the greater guns exceedingly
mobile, enabling them to go into action instantly upon arrival and to
depart to safety just as soon as their mission was accomplished.</p>

<p>Then, too, this artillery equipment must have adequate facilities for
maintenance in the field, and this need brought into existence another
enormous phase of the ordnance program. There must be mobile
ordnance repair shops for each division, consisting of miniature
machine shops completely fitted out with power and its transmission
equipment and mounted directly on motor trucks. Then there must
be semi-heavy repair shops on 5-ton tractors, these to be for the corps
what the truck machine shop was to the division. Each army headquarters
called for its semipermanent repair shop for artillery and
still larger repair shops for its railway artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>And in addition to all these were the base repair shops in France,
which were erected on a scale to employ a force three times as large
as the combined organizations of all the manufacturing arsenals of the
United States in time of peace, having a capacity for relining 1,000
cannon and overhauling and repairing 2,000 motor vehicles, 7,000
machine guns, 50,000 rifles, and 2,000 pistols every month. This
equipment of artillery and its maintenance organization implies the
flow from American industry of enormous quantities of repair
parts and spare parts to keep the artillery in good condition.</p>

<p>Coming next to the more personal equipment of the soldier, we find
the necessity confronting the Ordnance Department to manufacture
shoulder rifles by the million and cartridges for them by the billion.
The great war brought the machine gun into its own, requiring
in the United States the manufacture of these complicated and expensive
weapons by the tens of thousands, including the one-man
automatic rifle, itself an arm of a deadly and effective type.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the mass employment of machine guns in the
field came the development of the modern machine gun barrage, the
indirect fire, of which required sighting instruments of the most
delicate and accurate sort, and tripods with finely calibrated elevating
and traversing devices, so that the gunner might place the deadly
hail safely over the heads of his own unseen but advancing lines
and with maximum damage to the enemy. These thousands of
machine guns required water jackets to keep their barrels cool and
specially built carts to carry them.</p>

<p>The personal armament of the soldier also called for an automatic
pistol or a revolver for use in the infighting, when squads came in
actual contact with soldiers of the enemy. These had to be produced
by the hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>The requirements of the field demanded hundreds of thousands
of trench knives, murderous blades backed by the momentum of
heavily weighted handles, which in turn were protected by guards
embodying the principle of the thug's brass "knucks" armed with
sharp points.</p>

<p>Then there were the special weapons, largely born of modern trench
warfare. These included mortars, ranging from the small 3-inch
Stokes, light enough to go over the top and simple enough to be
fired from between the steadying knees of a squatting soldier, to the
great 240-millimeter trench mortar of fixed position. The mortars
proved to be exceedingly effective against concentrations of troops,
and so there was devised for them a great variety of bombs and shell,
not only of the high explosive fragmentation type, but also containing
poison gas or fuming chemicals. Great quantities both of mortars
and their ammunition were required.</p>

<p>From the security of the trenches the soldiers first threw out
grenades, which burst in the enemy's trenches opposite and created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
havoc. From the original device were developed grenades of
various sorts&mdash;gas grenades for cleaning up dugouts, molten-metal
grenades for fusing the firing mechanisms of captured enemy cannon
and machine guns, paper grenades to kill by concussion. Then
there were the rifle grenades, each to be fitted on the muzzle of a
rifle and hurled by the lift of gases following the bullet, which passed
neatly through the hole provided for it. The production of grenades
was no small part of the American ordnance problem.</p>

<p>In addition to these trench weapons were the Livens projectors,
which, fired in multiple by electricity, hurled a veritable cloud
of gas containers into a selected area of enemy terrain, usually with
great demoralization of his forces.</p>

<p>Bayonets for the rifles, bolos, helmets, periscopes for looking safely
over the edges of the trenches, panoramic sights, range finders&mdash;these
are only a few of the ordnance accessories of general application.</p>

<p>Then those innovations of the great war&mdash;the tanks&mdash;the 3-ton
"whippet," built to escort the infantry waves, the 6-ton tanks, most
used of all, and the powerful Anglo-American heavy tanks, each
mounting a 37-millimeter cannon and four machine guns.</p>

<p>The war in the air put added demands upon ordnance. It required
the stripped machine gun firing cartridges so rapidly that their explosions
merged into a single continuous roar, yet each shot so nicely
timed that it passed between the flying blades of the propeller.
There had to be electric heaters for the gun mechanisms to prevent
the oil which lubricated them from becoming congealed in the cold of
high altitudes. The airplane guns required armor-piercing bullets
for use against armored planes, incendiary bullets to ignite the hydrogen
of the enemy's balloon or to fire the gasoline escaping through the
wound in the hostile airplane's fuel tank, and tracer bullets to direct
the aim of the aerial gunner. Other equipment for the airman included
shot counters, to tell him instantly what quantity of ammunition
he had on hand, and gun sights, ingeniously contrived to
correct his aim automatically for the relative speed and direction of
the opposing plane. These were all developments in ordnance
brought about by the great war, and in each case they involved
problems for the production organization to solve.</p>

<p>Then there were the drop bombs of aerial warfare, of many gradations
in weight up to 500 pounds each, these latter experimental ones
forecasting the day when bombs weighing 1,600 pounds would be
dropped from the sky; then bomb sights to determine the moment
when the missile must be dropped in order to hit its target, sights
which corrected for the altitude, the wind resistance, and the rate of
speed of the airplane; and then mechanisms to suspend the bombs
from the plane and to release them at the will of the operator.</p>

<p>The list might be stretched out almost indefinitely&mdash;through pyrotechnics,
developed by the exigencies in Europe into an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
system; through helmets and armor, revivals from medieval times
to protect the modern soldier from injury; through the assortment
of heavy textiles, which gave the troops their belts, their bandoleers,
their haversacks, and their holsters; through canteens, cutlery for the
mess in the fields, shotguns, and so on, until there might be set down
thousands of items of the list which we know as modern ordnance.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the most important articles in this range are
articles of a noncommercial type. In other words, they are not the
sort of things that the industry of the country builds in time of peace,
nor learns how to build. Many other war functions came naturally
to a country skilled in handling food supplies for teeming populations,
in solving housing problems for whole cities, and in managing transportation
for a hundred million people; there was at hand the requisite
ability to conduct war enterprises of such character smoothly
and efficiently. Yet there was in the country at the outbreak of war
little knowledge of the technique of ordnance production.</p>

<p>The declaration of war found an American Ordnance Department
whose entire commissioned personnel consisted of 97 officers. Only
10 of this number were experienced in the design of artillery weapons.
The projected army of 5,000,000 men required 11,000 trained officers
to handle every phase of ordnance service. While a portion of this
production would have to do with the manufacture of articles of a
commercial type, such as automobiles, trucks, meat cans, mess equipment,
and the like, yet the ratio of 97 to 11,000 gives an indication
of the amount of ordnance knowledge possessed by the War Department
at the outbreak of war as compared to what it would
need to equip the first 5,000,000 men for battle.</p>

<p>The Government could obtain commissary officers from the food
industry; it could turn bank tellers into paymasters, or convert
builders into construction quartermasters; find transportation officers
in the great railway systems, Signal Corps officers in the telegraph
companies, or medical officers in professional life. But there was no
broad field to which ordnance could turn to find specialized skill
available. The best it could do was to go into the heavy manufacturing
industry for expert engineers who could later be trained
in the special problems of ordnance.</p>

<p>Prior to 1914 there were but six Government arsenals and two
large private ordnance works which knew anything about the
production of heavy weapons. After 1914, war industry sprang up in
the United States, yet in 1917 there were only a score or so of firms
engaged in the manufacture of artillery ammunition, big guns, rifles,
machine guns, and other important ordnance supplies for the allies.
When the armistice was signed nearly 8,000 manufacturing plants in
the United States were working on ordnance contracts. While
many of these contracts entailed production not much dissimilar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
commercial output, yet here is another ratio&mdash;the 20 or more original
factories compared with the ultimate 8,000&mdash;which serves as an
indication of the expansion of the industrial knowledge of the
special processes incident to ordnance manufacture.</p>

<p>When we found ourselves in the war the first step was to extend
our ordnance knowledge as quickly as possible. The war in Europe
had developed thousands of new items of ordnance, many of them
carefully guarded as military secrets, with which our own officers
were familiar only in a general way. As soon as we became a
belligerent, however, we at once turned to the allies, and they
freely and fully gave us of their store of knowledge&mdash;plans, specifications,
working models, secret devices, and complete manufacturing
processes.</p>

<p>With this knowledge at hand we adopted for our own program
certain French types of field guns and howitzers and British types of
heavy howitzers. The reproduction of the British types caused no
unusual difficulties, but the adoption of French plans brought into
the situation a factor the difficulties of which are apt not to be
appreciated by the uninitiated.</p>

<p>This new element for consideration was the circumstance that the
entire French system of manufacture in metals is radically different
from our own in its practices and is not readily adapted to American
methods.</p>

<p>The English and the American engineers and shops use inches and
feet in their measurements, but the French use the metric system.
This fact means that there was not a single standard American drill,
reamer, tap, die, or other machine-shop tool that would accurately
produce the result called for by a French ordnance drawing in the
metric system. Moreover, the French standards for metal stocks,
sheets, plates, angles, I-beams, rivet holes, and rivet spacing are far
different from American standards.</p>

<p>It was discovered that complete French drawings were in numerous
cases nonexistent, the French practice relying for small details upon
the memory and skill of its artisans. But even when the complete
drawings were obtained, then the American ordnance engineer was
confronted with the choice of either revolutionizing the machining
industry of the United States by changing over its entire equipment
to conform to the metric system, or else of doing what was done&mdash;namely,
translating the French designs into terms of standard
American shop practice, a process which in numerous cases required
weeks and even months of time on the part of whole staffs of experts
working at high tension.</p>

<p>Nor do the French know the American quantity-production methods.
The French artisan sees always the finished article, and he is given
discretion in the final dimensions of parts and in the fitting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
assembling of them. But the American mechanic sees only the part
in which he is a specialist in machining, working with strict tolerances
and producing pieces which require little or no fitting in the assembling
room. Consequently, in the translating of French plans it was
necessary to put into them what they never had before, namely,
rigid tolerances and exact measurements.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>One of the most striking developments of the present war has been the great increase
in the use of artillery to precede infantry action in battle. This is illustrated by a
comparison of the expenditure of artillery ammunition in characteristic battles of
recent wars with that in important battles of the present war. The special features
of the several battles should be kept in mind. Chickamauga was fought in a heavily
wooded region; Gettysburg and St. Privat over open farm land. The latter battles,
together with Nan Shan, and all the battles of the present war considered below,
involved artillery preparation for assault upon armies in defensive position. The
expenditures, therefore, are roughly comparable.</p>

<p>The high mark of the use of artillery in offensive battle was reached at the Somme
and Messines Ridge, before the effective use of tanks was developed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When an army of 100,000 men expands and becomes an army of
3,000,000, it becomes a job just 30 times bigger to feed the 3,000,000
than it was to feed the 100,000. A soldier of a campaigning army
eats no more than a soldier of a quiet military post. The same is
true approximately in the case of clothing an army. But the army's
consumption of ammunition in time of war is far out of proportion to
its numerical expansion to meet the war emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, an Army machine gun in time of peace might fire
6,000 rounds in practice during the year. This was the standard
quantity of cartridges provided in peace. Yet it is necessary to
provide for a single machine gun on the field in such a war as the
recent one 288,875 rounds of ammunition during its first year of
operation, this figure including the initial stock and the reserve
supply as well as the actual number of rounds fired. Thus the
machine gun of war increases its appetite, so to speak, for ammunition
4,700 per cent in the first year of fighting.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rates are based upon total expenditure and average number of guns in the

<p>A large part of the heavy expenditure of artillery ammunition in the present as
compared with other modern wars can be attributed to the increased rate of fire made
possible by improved methods of supply in the field and by the rapid-fire guns now
in use. In wars fought before the introduction of quick-firing field guns, four or five
rounds per day was the greatest average rate. Even this was reached only in the siege
of Sebastopol, where armies were stationary and supply by water was easy, and in
the American Civil War, which was characterized by advanced tactical developments.
The guns of the allied armies in France fired throughout the year 1918 at a
rate about seven times greater than these previously high rates.</p></div>
</div>
<p>In the case of larger weapons the increase in ammunition consumption
is even more startling. Prior to 1917 the War Department
allotted to each 3-inch field gun 125 rounds of ammunition per year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
for practice firing. Ammunition for the 75-millimeter guns (the
3-inch equivalent) was being produced to meet an estimated supply
of 22,750 rounds for each gun in a single year, or an increased consumption
of ammunition in war over peace of 18,100 per cent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The industrial effort necessary to maintain modern armies in action may be measured
to a certain extent by their expenditure of artillery ammunition. European wars of
the past 100 years were for the most part decided before peace-time reserves had been
exhausted. The American Civil War, however, required for its decision an industrial
mobilization at that time unprecedented, which, like the use in that war of intrenchments
by field armies, was more truly indicative of the trend of modern warfare than
were the conditions of the more recent European wars.</p></div>
</div>
<p>Thus when a peace army of 100,000 becomes a war army of
3,000,000 its ammunition consumption becomes not 30 times greater,
but anywhere from 48 to 182 times 30 times greater&mdash;an increase far
out of proportion to its increase in the consumption of food, clothing,
or other standard supplies. Modern invention has made possible and
modern practice has put into effect a greatly augmented use of
ammunition. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show graphically how ammunition
expenditure has increased in modern times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Another circumstance that complicated the ordnance problem
was the increasing tendency throughout the great war to use more
and more the mechanical or machine methods of fighting as opposed
to the older and simpler forms in which the human or animal factor
entered to a greater extent.</p>

<p>At the time the United States entered the war the regulations
prescribed 50 machine guns as the equipment for an infantry division.
When the armistice was signed the standard equipment of a
division called for 260 heavy machine guns and 768 light automatic
rifles. Of the heavy machine guns with a division, only 168 were
supposed to be in active service, the remainder being in reserve
or in use for antiaircraft work. However, the comparison in the
two standards of equipment shows the tendency toward machine
methods in the wholesale killing of modern warfare and indicates
the fresh demands made upon the ordnance organization to procure
this additional machinery of death. Moreover, when the fighting
came to an end the A. E. F. was on the point of adding to its regimental
and divisional equipment a further large number of automatic
rifles.</p>

<p>The day of the horse was passing in the great war as far as his
connection with the mobile artillery was concerned, and the gasoline
motor was taking his place, this tendency being accelerated particularly
by America, the greatest nation of all in automotivity. Trucks
and tractors to pull the guns, motor ammunition trucks displacing
the old horse-drawn caissons and limbers, even self-propelling platforms
for the larger field guns, with track laying or caterpillar mounts
supplying not only mobility for the gun but aiming facilities as well;
these were the fresh developments. Some of these improvements
were produced and put in the field, the others were under development
at the signing of the armistice. The whole tendency toward
motorization served to complicate ordnance production in this
country, not only in the supply of the weapons and traction devices
themselves, but in the production of increased supplies of ammunition,
since these improvements also tended to increase the rapidity with
which bullets and shell were consumed.</p>

<p>The total cost of the ordnance alone required to equip the first
5,000,000 Americans called to arms was estimated to be between
$12,000,000,000 and $13,000,000,000. This was equal to about half
of all the money appropriated by Congresses of the United States
from the first Continental Congress down to our declaration of war
against Germany, out of which appropriations had been paid the
cost of every war we ever had, including the Civil War, and the
whole enormous expenses of the Government in every official activity
of 140 years. To equip with ordnance an army of this size in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
period projected meant the expenditure of money at a rate which
would build a Panama Canal complete every 30 days.</p>

<p>Above are sketched some of the difficulties of the situation. In
our favor we had the greatest industrial organization in the world,
engineering skill to rank with any, a race of people traditionally
versatile in applying the forces of machinery to the needs of mankind,
inventive genius which could match its accomplishments with those
of the rest of the world added together, a capacity for organization
that proved to be astonishingly effective in such an effort as the
nation made in 1917 and 1918, enormous stores of raw materials,
the country being more nearly self-sufficient in this respect than any
other nation of the globe, magnificent facilities of inland transportation,
a vast body of skilled mechanics, and a selective-service law
designed to take for the Army men nonessential to the Nation's
industrial efforts for war and to leave in the workshops the men
whose skill could not be withdrawn without subtracting somewhat
from the national store of industrial ability.</p>

<p>It only remains to sketch in swift outlines something of the accomplishments
of the American ordnance effort. In general it may be
said that those projects of the ordnance program to which were
assigned the shorter time limits were most successful. There never
was a time when the production of smokeless powder and high explosives
was not sufficient for our own requirements, with large
quantities left over for both France and England.</p>

<p>America in 19 months of development built over 2,500,000
shoulder rifles, a quantity greater than that produced either by
England or by France in the same period, although both those
countries in April, 1917, at the time when we started, had their
rifle production already in a high stage of development. (See fig. 4.)
However, the Franco-British production of rifles dropped in rate in
1918 because there was no longer need for original rifle equipment
for new troops.</p>

<p>In the 19 months of war American factories produced over
2,879,000,000 rounds of rifle and machine-gun ammunition. This
was somewhat less than the production in Great Britain during the
same period and somewhat less than that of France; but America
began the effort from a standing start, and in the latter part of the
war was turning out ammunition at a monthly rate twice that of
France and somewhat higher than that of Great Britain. (See fig. 4.)</p>

<p>Between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, America produced
as many machine guns and automatic rifles as Great Britain did in
the same period and 81 per cent of the number produced by France;
while at the end of the effort America was building machine guns and
machine rifles nearly three times as rapidly as Great Britain and
more than twice as fast as France. (Fig. 4.) When it is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that a long time must elapse before machine-gun factories can be
equipped with the necessary machine tools and fixtures, the effort
of America in this respect may be fairly appreciated.</p>

<p>In artillery ammunition rounds of all calibers America at the end
of the war was turning out unfilled shell faster than the French and
nearly as fast as the British; but, due to the shortage in adapters
and boosters, a shortage rapidly being overcome at the end of the
war, the rate of production of completed rounds was only about
one-third that of either Great Britain or France. In total production
during her 19 months of belligerency America turned out
more than one-quarter as many unfilled rounds as Great Britain did
in the same time and about one-quarter as many as came from the
French munition plants. In completed rounds alone did America
lag far behind the records of the two principal allies during 1917 and
1918. (Fig. 5.)</p>

<p>The production of completed rounds of artillery ammunition was
gaining rapidly, beginning with the early summer of 1918, and in the
month of October was approaching half the rate of manufacture in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Great Britain or in France. Figure 6 shows graphically the rate at
which the artillery ammunition deliveries were expanding.</p>

<p>In artillery proper the war ended too soon for American industry
to arrive at a great production basis. The production of heavy
ordnance units is necessarily a long and arduous effort even when
plants are in existence and mechanical forces are trained in the work.
America in large part had to build her ordnance industry from the
ground up&mdash;buildings, machinery, and all&mdash;and to recruit and train
the working forces after that. The national experience in artillery
production in the great war most like our own was that of Great
Britain, who started in from scratch, even as we did. It is interesting,
then, to know how Great Britain expanded her artillery industry, and
the testimony of the British ministry of munitions may throw a new
light on our own efforts in this respect. In discussing artillery in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
war the British ministry of munitions issued a statement from which
the following is an excerpt:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is very difficult to say how long it was before the British army was thoroughly
equipped with artillery and ammunition. The ultimate size of the army aimed at
was continually increased during the first three years of the war, so that the ordnance
requirements were continually increasing. It is probably true to say that the equipment
of the army as planned in the early summer of 1915 was completed by September,
1916. As a result, however, of the battle of Verdun and the early stages of the
battle of the Somme, a great change was made in the standard of equipment per
division of the army, followed by further increases in September, 1916. The army
was not completely equipped on this new scale until spring, 1918.</p></div>

<p>Thus it took England three and a half years to equip her army
completely with artillery and ammunition on the scale called for at
the end of the war. On this basis America, when the armistice came,
had two years before her to equal the record of Great Britain in this
respect.</p>

<p>As to the production of gun bodies ready for mounting, the attainments
of American ordnance were more striking. At the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fighting America had passed the British rate of production and was
approaching that of the French. In totals for the whole war period
(Apr. 6, 1917, to Nov. 11, 1918) the American production of gun
bodies could scarcely be compared with either that of the British or
that of the French, this due to the fact that it required many months
to build up the forging plants before production could go ahead.</p>

<p>In completed artillery units the American rate of production at
the end of the war was rapidly approaching both that of the British
and that of the French. In total production of complete units in
the 19 months of war, American ordnance turned out about one-quarter
as many as came from the British ordnance plants and less
than one-fifth as many as the French produced in the same period.
Figure 8 represents visually America's comparative performances
in the production of gun bodies and complete artillery units.</p>

<p>Stress has sometimes been laid upon the fact that the American
Army was required to purchase considerable artillery and other
supplies abroad, the latter including airplanes, motor trucks, food
and clothing, and numerous other materials. Yet, balanced against
this fact is that every time we spent a dollar with the allied governments
for ordnance, we sold ordnance, or materials for conversion
into munitions to the allied governments to the value of five dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
The interallied ordnance agreement provided that certain munitions
plants in the United States should continue to furnish supplies
to the allies, and that additional plants for the allies should be built
up and fostered by us. Thus, while we were purchasing artillery
and ammunition from the allies we were shipping to them great
quantities of raw materials, half-completed parts, and completely
assembled units, and such war-time commodities as powder and
explosives, forgings for cannon and other heavy devices, motors, and
structural steel. The following table shows the ordnance balance

<p>The credit for the ordnance record can not go merely to those men
who wore the uniform and were part of the ordnance organization.
Rather it is due to American science, engineering, and industry, all
of which combined their best talents to make the ordnance development
worthy of America's greatness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

GUN PRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>The sole use of a gun is to throw a projectile. The earliest projectile
was a stone thrown by the hand and arm of man&mdash;either in
an attack upon an enemy or upon a beast that was being hunted for
food. Both of these uses of thrown projectiles persist to this day,
and during all time, from prehistoric days until now, every man who
had a projectile to throw was steadily seeking for a longer range
and a heavier projectile.</p>

<p>The man who could throw the heaviest stone the longest distance
was the most powerfully armed. In the Biblical battle between
David and Goliath, the arm of David was strengthened and lengthened
by a leather sling of very simple construction. Much practice
had given the young shepherd muscular strength and direction, and
his longer arm and straighter aim gave him power to overcome his
more heavily armed adversary.</p>

<p>Later, machines were developed after the fashion of a crossbow
mounted upon a small wooden carriage which usually was a hollowed
trough open on top and upon which a heavy stone was laid. The
thong of the crossbow was drawn by a powerful screw operated by
man power, and the crossbow arrangement when released would
throw a stone weighing many pounds quite a distance over the walls
of a besieged city or from such walls into the camps and ranks of
the besiegers. This again was an attempt by mechanical means to
develop and lengthen the stroke of the arm and the weight of the
projectile.</p>

<p>With the development of explosives, which was much earlier than
many people suppose, there came a still greater range and weight of
projectile thrown, although the first guns were composed of staves of
wood fitted together and hooped up like a long, slender barrel, wound
with wet rawhide in many folds, which, when dried, exerted a compressive
force upon the staves of the barrel exactly as do the steel
hoops of barrels used in ordinary commercial life to-day.</p>

<p>This, the first gun, sufficed for a long while until the age of iron
came. And then the same principle of gun construction was followed
as is seen in that historical gun, the "Mons Meg," in the castle
at Edinburgh. The barrel of that gun is made of square bars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
iron, placed lengthwise, and similar bars of iron were wrapped hot
around the staves to confine them in place and to give more resisting
power than was possible with the wooden staves and the rawhide
hooping.</p>

<p>Thus, all during the age of iron, gun development went steadily
forward. Every military power was always striving by the aid of
its best engineers, designers, and manufacturers to get a stronger
gun, either with or without a heavier projectile, but in every case
striving for greater power. As a special development we find in
March, 1918, the now famous long-range gun of the Germans, which
was at that time trained upon Paris, where it successfully delivered
a shell approximately 9 inches in diameter, punctually every 20
minutes for a good part of each day until the gun was worn out.
This occurred after a comparatively small number of shots, probably
not more than 75 in all. The rapid wearing out was due to the
immense demands of the long range upon the material of the gun.
The Germans in the shelling of Paris used three of these long-range
weapons and 183 shells are known to have fallen in the city.</p>

<p>The Germans evidently calculated with great care and experience
upon the factors leading up to this famous long-range type of gun,
which had an effective shooting distance of approximately 75 miles,
which range, in the opinion of our experts, it is now quite easy for an
experienced designer and manufacturer to equal and excel at will. In
fact, one would hesitate to place a limit upon the length of range that
could be achieved by a gun that it is now possible to design and build.
In this connection it is interesting to note that the great French ordnance
works at Le Creusot in 1892 produced the first known and well-authenticated
long-range gun, which was constructed from the design
of a 12-inch gun, but bored down to throw a 6-inch projectile. And
instead of the usual 8 miles expected from the flight of a 6-inch shell
this early Creusot long-range gun gave a range of approximately 21
miles with a 6-inch projectile, using a 12-inch gun's powder charge.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the development of the gun itself, and a necessary
element of the gun's successful use, is the requirement that the
weapon itself be easily transported from point to point, where its
available range and capacity for throwing the projectile can be
made of maximum use. This requires a gun carriage which has
within itself various functions, the primary one being to establish
the gun in the desired position where it can be made most effective
against the enemy. Then, too, the gun carriage must have stability
in order to withstand, absorb, and care for the enormous recoil
energies let loose by the firing of the gun. It is obvious that the
force which propels the projectile forward is equal to the reacting
force to the rear, and in order to care for, absorb, and distribute to
the earth this reacting force to the rear the carriage must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
within itself some very peculiar and important properties. To this
end there is provided what is known as a "brake" which permits the
gun, upon the moment of firing, to slide backward bodily within the
controlling apparatus mounted upon a fixed carriage.</p>

<p>The sliding of the whole gun to the rear by means of the mechanism
of the brake is controlled, as to speed and time, by springs, by compressed
air, by compressed oil, etc., either all together or in combinations
of two or three of these agencies; so that the whole recoil
energy is absorbed and the rearward action of the gun brought
to rest in a fraction of a second and in but a very few inches of
travel. The strains are distributed from the recoil mechanism to
the fixed portion of the carriage that is necessarily anchored to the
ground by means of spades, which the recoil force of each shot sets
more firmly into the ground, so that the whole apparatus is thus
steadily held in place for successive shots.</p>

<p>In mobile artillery, again, rapid firing is a prime essential. The
75-millimeter gun of modern manufacture is capable of being fired
at a rate in excess of 20 shots a minute&mdash;that is, a shot every 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Rarely however, is a gun served as rapidly as this. The more
usual rate of fire is 6 shots a minute or 1 about each 10 seconds, and
this rate of fire can be maintained in the 75-millimeter gun with
great accuracy over a comparatively long period.</p>

<p>The larger guns are served at proportionately slower rates,
until as the calibers progress to the 14-inch rifles, which have been
set up upon railway mounts as well as on fixed emplacements
for seacoast defense, the rate of fire is reduced to one shot in three
minutes for railway mounts, and to one shot a minute for seacoast
mounts, although upon occasions a more rapid rate of fire can be
reached.</p>

<p>Under rapid fire conditions, the gun becomes very hot, owing to
the heat generated by the combustion of the powder within the gun
at pressures as high as 35,000 pounds per square inch or more, which
are generated at the moment of fire. This heat is communicated
through the walls of the gun and taken off by the cooling properties of
the air. Nevertheless, the wall of the gun becomes so hot that it
would scorch or burn a hand laid upon it. The rapid fire and heating
of the gun lessens the effective life of the weapon, due to the fact
that the hot powder gases react more rapidly on hot metal than
they do upon cold metal; hence a gun will last many rounds longer
if fired at a slow rate than if fired at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to keep in mind throughout that the sole purpose
of a gun is to fire a projectile, as was stated at the very beginning
of this chapter. All other operations connected with the life of
a gun, its manufacture, its transportation to the place where it is to
be used, its aiming, its loading and all its functions and operations
are bound up in the single purpose of actually firing the shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider now for a moment, the life of, let us say, one of the 14-inch
guns.</p>

<p>In the great steel mills it requires hundreds and perhaps thousands
of workmen to constitute the force necessary to handle the enormous
masses of steel through the various processes which finally
result in the finished gun.</p>

<p>From the first operation in the steel mill it requires perhaps as
long as 10 months to produce the gun ready for the first test.
During the 10 months of manufacture of one of these 14-inch
rifles there has been expended for the gun and its carriage approximately
$200,000. Of course, while it requires 10 months to make a
final delivery of one gun after its first operation is commenced, it
should be remembered that yet other guns are following in series and
that in a well-equipped ordnance factory two and perhaps three
guns per month of this kind can be turned out continuously, if
required.</p>

<p>Remembering now that it requires 10 months to produce one such
14-inch rifle and that its whole purpose is to fire a shot, consider now
the time required to fire this shot. As the primer is fired and the
powder charge ignited the projectile begins to move forward in the
bore of the gun at an increasingly rapid rate, so that by the time it
emerges from the muzzle and starts on its errand of death and destruction,
it has taken from a thirtieth to a fiftieth of a second in time,
depending upon certain conditions.</p>

<p>Assuming that a fiftieth of a second has been taken up and that
the life of a large high-pressure gun at a normal rate of firing is 150
shots, it is obvious then that in the actual firing of these 150 shots
only three seconds of time are consumed. Therefore, the active life
of the gun, which it has taken 10 months to build, is but three
seconds long in the actual performance of the function of throwing
a shot.</p>

<p>However, after the gun has fired its life of 150 shots it is a comparatively
simple and inexpensive matter to bore out the worn-out liner
and insert a new liner, thus fitting the gun again for service, with an
expenditure of time and money much less than would be required in
the preparation of a new gun.</p>

<p>As the size of the powder charge decreases, a progressively longer
life of the walls of the bore of a gun is attained, so that we have had
the experience of a 75-millimeter gun firing 12,000 rounds without
serious effect upon the accuracy of fire. Large-caliber guns, such
as 12-inch howitzers, with the reduced powder charge required for
the lower muzzle velocities employed in howitzer attack, have retained
their accuracy of fire after 10,000 rounds.</p>

<p>From the fact that when in action guns are served with ammunition,
aimed, fired, and cared for by a crew of men carefully trained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
every motion involved in the successful use of the gun, it is most
essential that the design and the material shall be such, both as to
calculation in the design and as to manufacture in the material, as
will insure the maintenance of the morale of the crew that serves the
gun. Each man must be confident to the very last bit of fiber
in his make-up that his gun is the best gun in the world, that it
will behave properly, that it will protect him and his fellow soldiers
who are caring for the welfare of their country, that it will respond
accurately and well to every demand made upon it, that it will not
yield or burst, that it will not shoot wild, but that it will in every
respect give the result required in its operation.</p>

<p>To this end it has for generations been known that the requirements
of manufacture of ordnance material, particularly for the body
of the gun, are of the very highest order and call for the finest
attainable quality in material, workmanship, and design.</p>

<p>It is well known and admitted that the steel employed in the
manufacture of guns must be of the highest quality and of the finest
grade for its purpose. It requires the most expert knowledge of the
manufacture of steel to obtain this grade and quality. Until recently
this knowledge in America was confined to the Ordnance
officers of the Army and of the Navy and to a comparatively small
number of manufacturers&mdash;not more than four in all&mdash;and only
two of these manufacturers had provided the necessary equipment
and appliances for the manufacture of complete guns.</p>

<p>Until 1914 the number of guns whose manufacture was provided
for in this country as well as in the countries of Europe, excepting
Germany, was very small. It might be stated that the sum total of
guns purchased by the United States from the two factories mentioned
did not exceed an average of 55 guns a year in calibers of
from 3-inch to 14-inch, and that the stock of guns which by this
low rate of increase of manufacture had been provided for us was
pitifully small with which to enter a war of the magnitude of the
one through which this country has just passed.</p>

<p>The two factories in question not having been encouraged by
large purchases of ordnance material, as were similar industries in
Germany, were not capable of volume production when we entered
the war. But at the same time the gun bodies produced by these
concerns at least equaled in quality those built in any other country
on earth; so that while the big-gun-making art was in existence in
this country and was maintained as to quality, it was most insufficient
as to the quantity of the production available.</p>

<p>When the United States faced the war in April, 1917, arrangements
were at once entered into to obtain in the shortest space of
time an adequate supply of finished artillery of all calibers required
by our troops and to get this supply in time to meet our men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
they should set foot on the shores of France. Many thousands
of forgings for guns, and finished guns too, had been ordered by
the allies of the few gun makers in this country; and these makers
were, at the time we got into the conflict, fully occupied for at least
a year ahead with orders from the French and English ordnance
departments. All of this production was immediately useful and
available for the combined armies of the allies, and so it was
allowed to go forward, the forgings preventing a gap in the output of
the finished articles from the British and French arsenals which were
then using the semifinished guns made in the old factories in existence
in this country in April, 1917.</p>

<p>Some idea of the volume of this production in this country will
be gained from the following table showing material supplied to the
allies between April, 1917, and the date of the signing of the armistice,
November 11, 1918.</p>

</table>

<p>In supplying all of this material from our regular sources of manufacture
in this country to the finishing arsenals of the allies we were
but maintaining our position as a part of the general source of supply.
The plan of the French and British ordnance engineers at the outbreak
of the war in 1914 was to build their factories as quickly and as
extensively as could possibly be done. By the time the United States
entered the war all of these factories were in operation and clamoring
for raw material at a rate which was far in excess of that which could
be supplied by the home steel makers in Great Britain and France.
Consequently their incursions into the semifinished ordnance material
supplies in the United States were necessary. In sending these
large quantities of our own materials abroad, when we needed them
ourselves, we were distinctly adding to the rate and quantity of the
supply of finished ordnance for the use of our own Army in the field
as well as being at the same time of inestimable value to the allies.
This was because the French and British had agreed to supply our first
armies with finished fighting weapons while we were giving them the
raw materials which they needed so badly.</p>

<p>The four gunmakers in America meanwhile were being expanded
into a total of 19 makers. All of these 19 factories during the month
of October, 1918, were practically in full operation. Many of them
were producing big guns at a faster rate than that for which the plants
had been designed. In the month of October, 1918, with 3 of the 19
factories yet to have their machine-tool equipment completed, there
were produced 2,031 sets of gun forgings between the calibers of
3-inch and 9.5-inch, which is at the rate of upward of 24,000 guns a
year. This figure, of course, does not indicate anything of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>gun-finishing
capacity of the country; yet this expansion may be contrasted
to the fact that our supply of finished guns prior to 1917
amounted only to 55 weapons a year.</p>

<p>Our chain of gun factories, that were making this remarkable
production, were built as follows:</p>

<p>One at the Watertown Arsenal, Watertown, Mass., near Boston,
for the manufacture of rough machined gun forgings of the larger
mobile calibers. This factory was entirely built and equipped on
Government land with Government money and is splendidly able
to produce rough machined gun forgings of the highest quality at
the rate of two sets a day for the 155-millimeter G. P. F. rifles, and
one set a day of the 240-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>At Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, N. Y., large extensions were
made to the existing plant that had always been the Army's prime
reliance for the finishing and the assembly of guns of all calibers,
including the very largest. This plant was extended to manufacture
complete four of the 240-millimeter howitzers each day, and
two a day of the 155-millimeter G. P. F. guns.</p>

<p>At Bridgeport, Conn., there was constructed a complete new factory
by the Bullard Engineering Works for the United States to turn out
four 155-millimeter G. P. F. guns a day.</p>

<p>At Philadelphia, the Tacony Ordnance Corporation, as agents for
the Government, erected complete a new factory officered and manned
by experts well-trained and experienced in the difficult art of the
manufacture of steel and gun forgings. On October 11, 1917, the
grounds for this great undertaking had been merely staked out for
the outline of the buildings. Seven months later, on May 15, 1918,
the entire group of buildings, comprising a complete steel works from
making the steel to the final completion of 155-millimeter gun forgings,
was entirely erected at a cost of about $3,000,000. This difficult and
rapid building operation was carried through successfully during the
extraordinarily severe winter of 1917-18. On June 29, 1918, the first
carload of gun forgings was accepted and shipped from this plant,
so we have the marvelous enterprise of building a complete steel
works from the bare ground forward to the shipment of its first
forgings in a total elapsed time of only eight and one-half months.</p>

<p>At another, the works of the Midvale Steel Co. in Philadelphia,
large extensions were made to enable some of the larger guns to be
produced, to be finished later at the Watervliet Arsenal.</p>

<p>At the Bethlehem Steel Co.'s plant, Bethlehem, Pa., as early as
May, 1917, orders were placed and appropriations allotted for
expansions to this enterprise to enable a rapid output of a larger
number of gun forgings and finished guns.</p>

<p>Large extensions were made at the works of the Standard Steel
Works Co., Burnham, Pa., to increase their existing forging and
heat treating facilities, so that at this plant two sets of 155-millimeter
howitzers and one set of 155-millimeter gun forgings were
produced each day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>At Pittsburgh, Pa., the plants of the Heppenstall Forge &amp; Knife
Co. and the Edgewater Steel Co. were extended so as to provide for
the daily production at the first plant of forgings for one 3-inch
antiaircraft gun and one 4.7-inch gun, and at the second plant of
forgings for one 155-millimeter G. P. F. gun and one 240-millimeter
howitzer per day.</p>

<p>At Columbus, Ohio, the Buckeye Steel &amp; Castings Co. in combination
with the works of the Symington-Anderson Co. at Rochester,
N. Y., had their facilities extended to provide for the manufacture
each day of six sets of forgings for the 75-millimeter guns.</p>

<p>At the Symington-Anderson Co. in Rochester, N. Y., there was
provided a finishing plant for the 75-millimeter gun with a capacity
of 15 finished guns per day.</p>

<p>At Erie, Pa., one of the most remarkable achievements in rapid
construction and successful mechanical operation was performed by
the erection of a plant that was commenced in July, 1917, and out
of which the first production was shipped to the Aberdeen Proving
Grounds in February, 1918. The American Brake Shoe &amp; Foundry
Co. built and operated this plant as agents for the Ordnance
Department, and much credit is due them for their energy and
organizing capacity.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if history records any similar enterprise in which
guns were turned out in a plant seven months from the date of
beginning the erection of the factory. This plant was laid out to
manufacture 10 of the 155-millimeter Schneider-type howitzers a
day, and before the signing of the armistice it had more than fulfilled
every expectation by regularly turning out up to 15 howitzers a
day, or 90 a week.</p>

<p>At Detroit, Mich., the Chalkis Manufacturing Co. adapted an
existing plant, and additional facilities were erected for the manufacture
of three of the 3-inch antiaircraft guns each day.</p>

<p>At Madison, Wis., the Northwestern Ordnance Co. erected for
the United States an entire new factory, beautifully equipped for
the manufacture of four guns a day of the 4.7-inch model.</p>

<p>At Milwaukee, Wis., the Wisconsin Gun Co. put up for the Government
an entirely new works capable of finishing six 75-millimeter
guns each day. The plants at both Milwaukee and Madison
acquitted themselves very well and gave us guns of the highest
quality.</p>

<p>At Chicago, the Illinois Steel Co. expanded existing facilities
to produce more of the necessary electric furnace steel, which was
forged into guns at several works producing gun forgings, both for
the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>At Indiana Harbor, Ind., the works of the Standard Forgings Co.,
whose sole business had been the volume production of forgings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
steam hammers and hydraulic presses, were expanded to the enormous
degree of producing each day 10 sets of gun forgings for the
155-millimeter howitzer and 25 sets a day for the 75-millimeter gun.
It should be stated that this was a triumph of organizing ability and
that this factory was one of our main reliances for these guns.</p>

<p>At Gary, Ind., the American Bridge Co. created what is perhaps
the finest gun-forging plant in the world, comprising four presses
from 1,000 tons to 3,000 tons forging capacity and all the other necessary
apparatus for the production each day of two sets of 155-millimeter
G. P. F. guns and the equivalent of one and one-half sets
a day of the 240-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>At Baltimore, Md., the plant of the Hess Steel Corporation was
enlarged from its peace-time capacity and caused to produce at three
times its normal rate the special steels required for gun manufacture.</p>

<p>It will become evident that the collection of machinery, buildings,
and equipment necessary to produce these guns in the short space of
time required and at the rate of production stipulated, was an enormous
task in itself. It required the production of vast quantities of
raw materials and the congregating in one place of large numbers
of men capable of undertaking the exceedingly intricate mechanical
processes of manufacture. The success of this plan and its carrying
out is due largely to the loyalty of the manufacturers who unselfishly
came forward early in 1917 and agreed at the request of the Ordnance
Department to turn over their plants, lock, stock, and barrel, to the
requirements of the department; agreed also to undertake the manufacture
of products totally unfamiliar to them; agreed likewise
to lend all of their organizing ability and great material resources
to the success of the plants which the United States found necessary
to build in the creation of a new art, in new locations and in an
extent theretofore undreamed of.</p>


<h4>THE MAKING OF A BIG GUN.</h4>

<p>Steel, of course, and steel in some of its finest forms is the basis of
gun manufacture. The word "steel" for the purpose of producing
guns means much more than is ordinarily carried by the word in its
everyday and most commonly accepted use. Only steel of the very
highest quality is suitable for gun manufacture, as was indicated previously
when attention was directed to the complete reliance which the
operating crews must place in their guns and the severity of the uses
to which the big guns are put.</p>

<p>Let us take a hasty trip through a big gun plant, watching the
processes through which is finally evolved from the raw materials one
of our hardy and efficient big guns.</p>

<p>Entering an open-hearth furnace building at one of our big gun
plants, we find two large furnaces in which the raw materials are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
charged. Each of these furnaces is 75 feet long and 15 feet wide,
and in them in a shallow bath or pool lies the molten steel. The
pool is about 33 feet long by 12 feet wide and approximately 2&frac12; feet
deep. This pool, or "bath" as it is termed, weighs approximately
60 tons and is composed of pig iron and well-selected scrap steel
from previous operations.</p>

<p>The furnace is at all times during the operation of melting these
raw materials in the bath kept at such a high temperature that the
eye may not look within at the molten mass without being protected
with blue glass or smoked glass, exactly as when looking at the
noonday sun. The eye can see nothing in the atmosphere of the
bath in which the steel is being melted and refined because the
temperature is so exceedingly high that it gives a light as white as
that of the sun.</p>

<p>After 12 or 15 hours of refining treatment in this furnace the metal
is tested, analyzed in the chemical laboratory, and, if found to be
refined to the proper degree, it is allowed to flow out of the furnace
on the opposite side from that through which it entered. Flowing
out of the furnace the entire charge of 60 tons finds its way into a
huge ladle which is suspended from a traveling crane capable of
safely carrying this great weight.</p>

<p>The ladle is then transferred by the crane to a heavy cast-iron
mold which is built so as to contain as much of the 60 tons of molten
metal as is required for the particular gun forging under manufacture.</p>

<p>The mold, which we have before us now on our imaginary trip
through the gun plant, will provide an "ingot" from the molten
metal that will be 40 inches in diameter and 100 inches high. On
top of this ingot is a brick-lined so-called "sinkhead." This sinkhead
is that portion of the molten metal that has been allowed to
cool more slowly in the brick lining than the ingot does in the cast-iron
mold proper. The ingot with the sinkhead will weigh approximately
60,000 pounds.</p>

<p>This sinkhead is to insure greater solidity to the portion of the
ingot which is used for the gun forging. Only that part of the ingot
below the sinkhead enters the forging. The sinkhead itself is cut off
while hot under the press in a subsequent operation and afterwards
remelted.</p>

<p>Next the ingot is placed under a 2,000-ton forging press which
handles ingots up to 45 inches in diameter. There it is forged into a
square shape after coming from the mold in an octagonal form.
Previous to its being put under this press, however, a careful chemical
analysis has been made of the ingot to determine that it is satisfactory
for gun purposes, and then before being put under the press
the whole ingot is heated in the charge chamber and fired either by
a gas or oil flame.</p>

analysis to determine its fitness for use as a gun barrel.</p></div>

<p>The ingot out of which this tube was made, came from the mold in an octagonal shape and later was forged into a
square shape and finally made round. It now, too, has the hole bored partially into it. Through this hole,
ultimately, will pass the projectile.</p></div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The forging press used for the larger caliber guns, such as 14-inch
and 16-inch, is of a 9,000-ton weight capacity.</p>

<p>After the ingot forging has been reduced from squareness to a
cylindrical shape under the press, it is allowed to cool, then taken to
the machine shop, where it is turned and the hole through which
the projectile ultimately will pass is bored into it. This hole is
somewhat smaller than the diameter of the projectile, because in
the finishing operation, when the gun is assembled finally and put
together, the hole must be within one-one-thousandth of an inch of
the diameter required, which is all the tolerance that is allowed
from the accuracy to which the projectiles are brought. Otherwise
the accuracy of the gun in firing would be injured and the reliability
of its aim would not be satisfactory.</p>

<p>During all of these operations with the ingot, the steel is largely
in the soft condition in which it left the forging press. As is well
known, steel is capable of taking many degrees of "temper." Temper
is an old term that no longer is quite descriptive of the condition
desired or obtained, but it is sufficiently expressive of the condition
desired for the purposes here. This condition is one of a certain
degree of hardness&mdash;greater than that ordinarily carried by the soft
steel&mdash;combined with the greatest obtainable degree of toughness.
This combination of hardness and toughness produced to the proper
degree resists the explosive power of the powder and also causes the
wear on the gun in firing to be diminished and made as slight as
possible.</p>

<p>To effect this combination of hardness and toughness it is necessary
to take the bored and turned tubes of the guns and suspend
them by means of a specially made apparatus in a furnace where they
are heated for a period of perhaps eight hours to a temperature of
approximately 1,500&deg; F. or a bright-yellow color, uniform in every
part of the piece.</p>

<p>After being subjected to this treatment for the time mentioned,
the tube is then conducted by means of a traveling crane apparatus
to a tank of warm water in which it is dipped and the
heat rapidly taken from it down to a point of practically atmospheric
temperature. This "quench" as it is called, produces the
required degree of hardness called for by the ordnance officers'
design; but the piece has not yet got the required degree of toughness.
This toughness is now imparted to the hard piece by heating
it once more in another furnace to a temperature of approximately
1,100&deg; F., or a warm rosy red, for a period of perhaps 14 hours.
From this temperature, the piece is allowed to cool naturally and
slowly to the atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>The ordnance inspectors at this point determine whether the piece
has the required properties in a sufficient degree, by cutting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
tube a piece 5 inches long and &frac12; inch in diameter. The ends of this
piece are threaded suitably for gripping in a machine. The piece is
then pulled until the half-inch stem breaks. The machine registers
the amount of force required to break this piece and this gives the
ordnance engineer his test as to the degree of hardness and toughness
to which the piece has been brought by the heat treatment
processes just described.</p>

<p>A satisfactory physical condition having been determined by
pulling and breaking the test pieces described, the whole forging is
sent to the finishing shop where it is machined to a mirror polish on
all its surfaces. The diameters are accurately measured and the forgings
assembled into the shape of a finished gun.</p>

<p>In this process there is required a different kind of care and accuracy.
Up until this time the care has been to provide a metal of
proper consistency and quality. From this point forward the manufacture
of a gun requires the machining and fitting of this metal into
a shape and form so accurate that the full strength of the gun and
the best accuracy of fire may be attained.</p>

<p>To explain how and why hoops are placed upon the gun tubing
and how the various hoops are shrunk from the outside diameter of
the gun will require a few lines.</p>

<p>Cannon are made of concentric cylinders shrunk one upon another.
The object of this method of construction is twofold. The distinctly
practical object is the attainment throughout the wall of each cylinder
of the soundness and uniformity of metal which is more certainly to
be had in thin pieces than in thick ones; the other object is more
closely connected with the theory of gun construction.</p>

<p>When a hollow cylinder is subjected to an interior pressure the
walls of the cylinder are not uniformly strained throughout their
thickness, but the layer at the bore is much more severely strained
than that at the outside. This can be readily seen if we consider a
cylinder of rubber, for example, with a bore of 1 inch and an exterior
diameter of 3 inches, which are about the proportions of many guns.
If we put an interior air pressure on the cylinder until we expand the
bore to 2 inches, the exterior diameter will not thereby be increased 1
inch. But supposing that it were increased as much as the bore,
that is, 1 inch, we would have the diameter, and therefore the circumference,
of the bore increased 100 per cent, and the circumference
of the exterior increased 33&#x2153; per cent. That is, the layer at the bore
would be strained three times as much as that at the exterior, and the
interior layer would commence to tear before that at the exterior
would reach anything like its limit of strength. The whole wall of
the cylinder therefore would not be contributing its full strength
toward resisting the interior pressure, and there would be a waste of
material as well as a loss of strength.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Let us now consider, instead of our simple cylinder, a built-up
cylinder composed of two concentric ones, the inner one of a bore
originally a little greater than 1 inch, and the outer one of exterior
diameter a little less than three inches, originally; so that when the
outer one is pressed over the inner one (its inner diameter being originally
too small for it to go over the inner one without stretching) the
bore of the inner one is brought to 1 inch, and the exterior of the outer
one to 3 inches. We now have a cylinder of the same dimensions as
our simple one, but in a different state; the layers of the inner one being
compressed and those of the outer one extended.</p>

<p>If now we commence to put air pressure on the bore, we can put on
a certain amount before we wipe out the compression of the inner
layer, and bring it to a neutral state, and thereafter can go on putting
on more pressure until we stretch the inner layer 100 per cent beyond
the neutral state, as before; which would take just as much additional
pressure as the total pressure which we employed with our simple
cylinder. We have therefore gained all that pressure which is necessary
to bring the inner layer of our built-up cylinder from its state of
compression to the neutral state. If we have so proportioned the
diameter of junction of our inner and outer cylinders and so gauged
the amount of stretching required to get the outer one over the inner
one that we have not in the process caused any of the layers of the
outer one to be overstrained, the gain has been a real one, attained by
causing the layers of the outer cylinder to make a better contribution
of strength toward resisting the interior pressure. This is the theory
of the built-up gun.</p>

<p>The number of cylinders employed generally increases, up to a
certain limit, with the size of the gun, practical considerations governing;
and the "shrinkage," or amount by which the inner diameter
of the outer cylinder is less than the outer diameter of the one which
it is to be shrunk over, is a matter of nice calculation. Roughly
speaking, it is about one and one half one-thousandths of an inch for
each inch of diameter, varying with the position of the cylinder in
the gun; and its accurate attainment, throughout the length of the
cylinder of a large gun, is a delicate matter of the gun-maker's art
and the machinist's skill.</p>

<p>The method of assembly is to have the cold tube set upright and
prepared for a circulation of water within the bore of the tube to
keep it cool. Then the hoop, whose inside diameter is smaller
than the outside diameter of the tube on which it is to be shrunk,
is measured and carefully heated to a temperature of approximately
450&deg; F., or just about the temperature of a good oven for baking or
roasting. This mild temperature so expands the material in the hoop
that the difference of diameter is overcome and the hot hoop is expanded
to a larger inside diameter than the outside diameter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
cold tube on which the hoop is to be placed. Next the hot, expanded
hoop is placed in position around the breech end of the tube, and
slowly and carefully cooled, so that in contracting from the high temperature
to the low ordinary temperature, the hoop shrinks toward its
original diameter and thus exerts an inclosing pressure or compressive
strain upon the breech end of the tube.</p>

<p>Now when the gun is fired the tube tends to expand under the
pressure and this expansion is resisted, first by the compressive
force exerted by the shrunken hoop and later by the hoop itself,
so that the built-up system is stronger and better able to resist
the explosive charge of the burning powder than would be the case
if the gun were made in one piece and of the same thickness of
metal.</p>

<p>This brief explanation will show why so many pieces are provided
for the manufacture of the finished gun and the reason for the large
number of machine tools and machining operations necessary in
order to carry forward the manufacture of the finished article. Sometimes
one or more of the outer cylinders are replaced by layers of
wire, wound under tension.</p>

<p>Both our 4.7-inch gun, model 1906, with which our troops have
been equipped for a long time and which throws a projectile weighing
45 pounds a distance of about 6 miles, and the French 75-millimeter
(2.95-inch) gun, successfully used by the French since 1897, were
designed to be drawn by horses, and the guns are best used when
drawn by teams of 6 or 8 horses. As the horse has a sustained pulling
power of only 650 pounds, it is obvious that the weight to be drawn
by the team of 6 horses must not be more than 3,900 pounds. So
there is every incentive for making mobile artillery of this kind as
light as possible, consistent with the strength required for the work
to be done. Thus the pulling power of the horse coupled with his
speed has been the limiting factor in the design and weight of mobile
field artillery.</p>

<p>As one of our foremost United States ordnance engineers once
said, "the limited power of the horse is what has governed the
weight of our artillery," and that "if Divine Providence had given
the horse the speed of the deer and the power of the elephant, we
might have had a far wider and more effective range for our mobile
artillery."</p>

<p>One of the answers of the United States ordnance engineers to
this problem, as developed in the recent war, has been the production
of a tractor to replace the horse, and this tractor has the speed of
the deer and the power of the elephant. The most powerful tractors
are mounted on track-laying devices and are colloquially known
as caterpillars. One of these powerful caterpillars, on which is
mounted an 8-inch howitzer with a range of 6 miles, which is
manned and operated by only two men, and which can go up hill
and down hill, over broken brushwood, trees, etc., was recently
given a severe test at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Here it was
sent through a dense wood in which it bumped square into a live
locust tree that was 17 inches in diameter at the bottom. This tree,
almost the tallest in the wood, was prostrated by the attack of the
tractor, which rode over it and then emerged from the wood, took up
its position, and fired its shot almost in as short a time as that which
it takes to tell of the deed. Truly the power of the elephant and
the speed of the deer has been brought to the aid of the ordnance
engineer for any future warlike operations.</p>

<p>The number of workmen employed in gun production at once in
this country totaled 21,329, and fully that many more are estimated
to have been employed in the manufacture of gun carriages and fire-control
instruments. Consequently in turning out the complete
big guns there were fully 42,000 workmen engaged by the month
of October, 1918. Furthermore, these men became so skilled in
their work that it may be said that the difficult art of gun making
has become firmly established in this country and that the United
States may now and at any time in the near future rely on this
trained body of artisans for the finest kind of gun-metal manufacture.</p>

<h3>Chapter III<br />

MOBILE FIELD ARTILLERY.</h3>


<p>The chance observer might assume that once the Ordnance Department
had succeeded in putting in production the cannon of various
sizes described in the preceding chapter the battle of providing
artillery was as good as won. But such was not the case. Even
after the ponderous tubes had come finished from the elaborate
processes of the steel mills, the task of the ordnance officers had only
just begun. Each one of these guns had to be rendered mobile in
the field and it had to be equipped with a mechanism to take up the
retrograde shock of firing (the "kick") and to prevent the weapon
from leaping out of aim at each discharge.</p>

<p>Mobility to a gun is given by the carriage on which it rides. The
device which absorbs the recoil and restores the gun to position is
called the recuperator (in the case of the hydropneumatic French
design) or the recoil mechanism. Carriage and recuperator, or recoil
mechanism, together are known as the mount.</p>

<p>The forging, boring, reinforcing, machining, and finishing of the
gun body is not half the battle of manufacturing a modern military
weapon; it is scarcely one-third of it. No ordnance officer of
1917-18 will ever forget the heartbreaking experiences of manufacturing
the mounts, a work which went along simultaneously with the
production of the cannon themselves. The manufacture of carriages
often presented engineering and production problems of the most
baffling sort. As to the recuperators, a short analysis of the part
they play in the operation of a gun will indicate something of the
nature of the project of building them in quantities.</p>

<p>The old schoolbook axiom that action and reaction are equal has a
peculiar emphasis when applied to the firing of a modern piece of
high-power artillery. The force exerted to throw a heavy projectile
7 miles or more from the muzzle of a gun is equally exerted toward
the breach of the weapon in its recoil. Some of these forces handled
safely and easily by mechanical means are almost beyond the mind's grasp.</p>

<p>Not long ago a touring car, weighing 2 tons, traveled at the rate of
120 miles an hour along a Florida beach. Conceive of such a car
going 337 miles an hour, which is much faster than any man ever
traveled; then conceive of a mechanism which would stop this car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
going nearly 6 miles a minute, stop it in 45 inches of space and half
a second of time, without the slightest injury to the automobile.
That is precisely the equivalent of the feat performed by the recuperator
of a 240-millimeter howitzer after a shot.</p>

<p>Conceive of a 150,000-pound locomotive traveling at 53.3 miles an
hour. The action of the 240-millimeter recuperator after a shot is
equivalent to stopping that locomotive in less than 4 feet in half a
second without damage.</p>

<p>The forging for the 155-millimeter howitzer's recuperator is a
block of steel weighing nearly 2 tons&mdash;in exact figures, 3,875 pounds.
This must be bored and machined out until it weighs, with the accessory
parts of the complete recuperator placed on the scales with it,
only 870 pounds. It is scarcely fair to a modern hydropneumatic
recuperator to say that it must be finished with the precision of a
watch. It must be finished with a mechanical nicety comparable
only to the finish of such a delicate instrument as a navigator's
sextant or the mechanism which adjusts the Lick telescope to the
movement of the earth. No heavy articles ever before turned out
in American workshops required in their finish the degree of microscopic
perfection the recuperators called for.</p>

<p>We adopted from the French, the greatest of all artillery builders,
four recuperators&mdash;one for the 75-millimeter gun, one for the 155-millimeter
gun, another for the 155-millimeter howitzer, and the
fourth for the 240-millimeter howitzer. These mechanisms had
never been built before outside of France. Indeed, one could find
pessimists ready to say that none but French mechanics could build
them at all and that our attempt to duplicate them could end only
in failure. Yet American mechanical genius "licked" every one of
these problems, as the men in the greasy overalls say, and did it in
little more than a year of time after the plans came to the workshops.
There was not one of these beautiful mechanisms, in France the
product of patient handiwork on the part of metal craftsmen of deep
and inherited skill, that eventually did not become in American
workshops a practical proposition of quantity production.</p>

<p>The problem of building French recuperators in the United States,
in short, may be regarded as the crux of the whole American ordnance
undertaking in the war against Germany, the index of its success.
It presented the most formidable challenge of all to American industrial
skill. There were men whose opinion had to be considered and
who were convinced that it was impracticable to attempt to produce
French recuperators here. Although the superiority of these recoil
devices in their respective classes were universally conceded, Germany
had never been able to make them, while England, with the cooperation
of the French ordnance engineers freely offered, did not attempt
them. The French built them one by one, as certain custom-built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and highly expensive automobiles are produced. When American
factories proposed to produce French recuperators not only but to
manufacture them by making parts and assembling them according
to the modern practice of quantity production, the ranks of the skeptics
increased.</p>

<p>Yet, as we have said, the thing was done. The first of these recuperators
ever produced outside of the French industry were produced
in America and manufactured by typically American quantity
methods.</p>

<p>The first of these recuperators to come into quantity production was
that for the 155-millimeter howitzer. Rough forgings began to be
turned out in heavy quantities by the Mesta Machine Co. in the spring
of 1918, while the Watertown Arsenal, the other contractor, reached
quantity production in rough forgings in September, 1918. At their
special recuperator plant at Detroit the Dodge Bros. turned out the
first finished 155-millimeter howitzer recuperator in July, 1918, and
went into quantity production with them in September, producing
495 in the month of November alone, and turning out up to the end
of April, 1919, the great number of 1,601 of them.</p>

<p>Next in order of time to be conquered as a factory problem was the
155-millimeter gun recuperator. The rough forgings at the Carnegie
Steel Co., the sole contractor, were in quantity production in the
spring of 1918. The first of these recuperators finished came from
the Dodge plant in October, 1918; and although 30 issued from the
plant and were accepted before the end of the year, quantity production
may be said to have started on January 1, 1919, when the factory
began producing them at the rate of more than four a day. In March
the high mark of 361 recuperators was reached, and the total production
up to the end of April was 880.</p>

<p>The heavy 240-millimeter howitzer recuperator was third to come
into quantity production. The rough forgings were being turned out
in quantity in the spring of 1918 by the Carnegie Steel Co., while the
Watertown Arsenal, the other contractor, produced a number of these
rough forgings in August, 1918. The two contractors for finishing
and turning out the complete recuperators were the Otis Elevator Co.,
at its Chicago plant, and the Watertown Arsenal. The arsenal produced
the pilot recuperator in October, 1918. In January the Otis
Elevator Co. produced its first four, while quantity production began
in February, 1919, both contractors that month sending out 19 recuperators,
a number which may be regarded as good quantity when
the size of this mechanism is taken into consideration. Both plants
together in April turned out the large number of 89 recuperators for
the 240.</p>

<p>Last to come through to quantity production was the hardest of
the four to build, the one that promised to defy American industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to build it at all&mdash;the 75-millimeter gun recuperator. The two contractors
for the rough forgings for this recuperator were the Carbon
Steel Co. and the Bucyrus Co. The Carbon Steel Co. was in large
series production of them in the spring of 1918, and the Bucyrus Co.
reached the quantity basis of manufacture in October, 1918. In that
month alone both contractors together turned out 1,305 sets of
forgings.</p>

<p>The machining and finishing of the 75 recuperator was in the hands
of the Rock Island Arsenal and the Singer Manufacturing Co., which
built a costly plant especially for the purpose at Elizabethport, N. J.
The first recuperator of this size to appear and be accepted under the
severe tests came from the arsenal in October. Thereafter the production
ceased for a while. The contractors indeed built recuperators
in this period, but the recuperators could not pass the tests. The
machining and production of parts seemed to be as perfect as human
skill could accomplish, but still the devices would not function perfectly.
Adjustments, seemingly of the most microscopical and
trivial sort, had to be made&mdash;there was trouble with the leather of the
valves and with oil for the cylinders. These matters, which could
scarcely cause any delay at all in the production of less delicate
machinery, indicate the infinite care which had to be employed in the
manufacture of the recuperators. At length the producers smoothed
out the obstacles and learned all the secrets and necessary processes,
and then the 75-millimeter recuperators began to come&mdash;2 in January,
1919, and then 13 in February, 20 in March, and 23 in April.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that by quantity production in this particular
is meant the production in quantity of recuperators of such
perfect quality as to pass the inspection of the Government and to be
accepted as part of our national ordnance equipment. In this
inspection the Government was assisted by French engineers sent
from the great artillery factories in France which had designed the
recuperators and which until the successful outcome of the American
attempt were their sole producers. Such inspection naturally
required that the American recuperators should be the equals of their
French prototypes in every respect.</p>

<p>Because the production of French recuperators stands at the summit
of American ordnance achievement, here at this point, before
there is given any account of the manufacture of field artillery, the
theme of this chapter, a performance table is inserted to show the
records written by the various concerns engaged in making these
devices.</p>

<p>The process of manufacture of recuperators requires four steps&mdash;forging, rough machining, finish machining, and assembling. In the case of 155-millimeter howitzer recuperators
all the machining was done by one firm; in the other cases rough machining was done by various firms, including, in the case of the 155-millimeter gun and 240-millimeter howitzer
recuperators, the firms doing the forging. Complete records of rough machining are not available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In discussing here, therefore, the production of field artillery in
the war period, we are concerned chiefly with carriages and recuperators,
for they offered the major difficulties. Since the production
of gun bodies for these various units has been taken up in the preceding
chapter, such reference to them as is necessary will be brief.
For the sake of additional clearness in the mind of the reader inexpert
in these things, the line should be sharply drawn between
field artillery and the so-called railway artillery, which was also
mobile to a limited degree. The mobile field artillery consisted of
all rolling guns or caterpillar guns up to and including the 240-millimeter
howitzer in size; and also included the antiaircraft guns
of various sizes. All mobile guns of larger caliber than the 240-millimeter
howitzer were mounted on railroad cars.</p>

<p>The list of the mobile field artillery weapons in manufacture here
during the war period was as follows:</p>

<p>The little 37-millimeter gun, the so-called infantry cannon, one of
which two husky men could lift from the ground&mdash;a French design;</p>

<p>The 75-millimeter guns&mdash;three types of them&mdash;the French 75,
adopted bodily by the United States; our own 3-inch gun redesigned to
the French caliber; and the British 3.3-inch gun, similarly redesigned;</p>

<p>The 4.7-inch gun of American design;</p>

<p>The 5-inch and 6-inch guns, taken from our coast defenses and
naval stores and placed on mobile mounts;</p>

<p>The 155-millimeter gun, a French weapon with a barrel diameter of
approximately 6 inches;</p>

<p>The 155-millimeter howitzer, also French;</p>

<p>The 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers, British designs, being manufactured
in the United States when war was declared;</p>

<p>The 240-millimeter howitzer, French and American; and, finally,</p>

<p>The antiaircraft guns.</p>

<p>In modern times, but prior to 1917, the United States had designed
types of field-artillery weapons and produced them in quantities
shown by the following tabulation:</p>

<p>A comparison of this list with the enumeration above of weapons
put in production during the war against Germany indicates that
we greatly expanded our artillery in types. That we were able to
do this at the outset and go ahead immediately with the production
of many weapons strange and unknown to our experience, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
waiting to develop models and types of our own, is due solely to the
generosity of the governments of France and Great Britain, with
whom we became associated. We manufactured in all eight new
weapons, taking the designs of three of them from the British and of
five from the French.</p>

<p>It might seem to the uninitiated that the way of the United States
to a great output of artillery would be made smooth by the action of
the British and French Governments in agreeing to turn over to us
without reservation the blue prints and specifications that were the
product of years of development in their gun plants. Yet this was
only relatively true. In numerous instances we were not able to
secure complete drawings until months after we had entered the
war, due to the practice of continental manufacturers that intrusts
numerous exact measurements to the memories of the mechanics
working in their shops. Consequently it required several months to
complete drawings, and when we received them our troubles had
only begun.</p>

<p>First there came the problem of translating the plans after we received
them. All French dimensions are according to the metric system.
A millimeter is one one-thousandth part of a meter, and a meter
is 39.37 inches. An inch is approximately 0.0254 meter. Thus to
translate French plans into American factory practice involves hundreds
of mathematical computations, most of them carried out to
decimals of four or five places. Moreover, the French shop drawings
are put down on an angle of projection different from what is used
in this country. This fact involved the recasting of drawings even
when the metric system measurements were retained. When it is
considered that such a mechanism as the recuperator on the
155-millimeter gun involves the translation of 416 drawings, the fact
that the preparation of French plans for our own use never took
more than two months is remarkable, particularly so since it was hard
to find in the United States draftsmen and engineers familiar with
such translation work.</p>

<p>Once our specifications were worked out from the French plans, it
then became necessary to find American manufacturers willing to
bid on the contracts. The average manufacturer would look at these
specifications, realize what a highly specialized and involved sort of
work would be required in the production of the gun carriages or
recoil mechanisms, and shake his head. In numerous instances no
such work had ever before been attempted in the United States.</p>

<p>However, as the result of efforts on the part of the Government
an increased capacity for producing mobile field artillery was created
as follows:</p>

<p>At Watertown, N. Y., the New York Air Brake Co., as agent for
the United States, constructed a completely new factory to turn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
25 gun carriages a month for the 75-millimeter guns, model 1916&mdash;the
American 3-inch type modified to the French dimensions.</p>

<p>At Toledo, Ohio, increased facilities were put up at the plant of
the Willys-Overland Co. to manufacture a daily output of 17 French
75-millimeter gun carriages, model 1897.</p>

<p>At Elizabethport, N. J., the Singer Manufacturing Co. erected for
the Government a complete new factory for finishing daily 17 French
75-millimeter recuperators.</p>

<p>At New Britain, Conn., the plant of the New Britain Machine Co.
was adapted and increased facilities were created for the manufacture
of two 3-inch antiaircraft gun carriages a day.</p>

<p>At Detroit, Mich., Dodge Bros., as agents for the Government,
erected an entirely new factory, costing in the neighborhood of
$11,000,000 to give the final machining to the rough-machine forgings
for five recuperators daily for the 155-millimeter gun and to
machine completely the parts for twelve recuperators daily for the
155-millimeter howitzer. Their huge new plant for this purpose
established a record for rapidity of construction in one of the most
severe winters of recent history.</p>

<p>At the plant of the Studebaker Corporation at Detroit, facilities
were extended for turning out three carriages a day for the 4.7-inch
guns.</p>

<p>At Plainfield, N. J., extended facilities were created at the factory
of the Walter Scott Co. for manufacturing 20 carriages a month
for the 4.7-inch guns.</p>

<p>At Worcester, Mass., at the plant of the Osgood Bradley Car Co.
increased facilities were built for the daily manufacture of five
carriages for the 155-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>At Hamilton, Ohio, at the works of the American Rolling Mill
Co., extensions were made to provide for the manufacture each day
of three carriages for the 155-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>The plant of the Mesta Machine Co., at West Homestead, Pa.,
near Pittsburgh, was extended to the enormous capacity of turning
out the forgings for 40 recuperators a day for the 155-millimeter
howitzers.</p>

<p>Extensively increased facilities were made at the shops of the
Standard Steel Car Co., at Hammond, Ind., for the daily output of
two carriages for the 240-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>Increased facilities were created in the plant of the Otis Elevator
Co., Chicago, Ill., for the finish machining of the equivalent in
parts of two and one-half recuperators a day for the 240-millimeter
howitzers.</p>

<p>Large extensions were made to the plant of the Morgan Engineering
Co., Alliance, Ohio, for the manufacture monthly of 20 improvised
mounts for the 6-inch guns taken from the seacoast fortifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The facilities of the United States arsenals at Watertown, Mass.,
and at Rock Island, Ill., for the manufacture of field-gun carriages
and recuperators were greatly increased.</p>

<p>This carriage construction for the big guns required the closest
kind of fine machine work and fittings where the brake or recuperator
construction entered the problem, and the great plants built for this
purpose of turning out carriages and recuperators were marvels for
the rapidity of their construction, the speed with which they were
equipped with new and intricate tools, and the quality of their output.</p>

<p>Every mobile gun mount must be equipped with a shield of armor
plate. The size of the artillery project may be read in the fact that
our initial requirement for armor for the guns ran to a total of 15,000
tons to be produced as soon as it could be done. Now, we had no
real source for getting armor in such large quantities, because the
previous demands of our artillery construction had never called for
it. The prewar manufacturers of artillery armor were three in number&mdash;the
Simmons Manufacturing Co., of St. Louis; Thomas Disston
&amp; Sons, of Philadelphia; and the Crucible Steel Co. To meet the
new demand two armor sources were developed&mdash;the Mosler Safe
Co. plant of the Standard Ordnance Co. and the Universal Rolling
Mill Co. The process of building this armor had been a closely
guarded secret in the past, a fact entailing extended experiments
in the new plants before satisfactory material could be obtained.</p>

<p>The new artillery program required the manufacture of 120,000
wheels of various types and sizes for the mobile carriages. The Rock
Island Arsenal and two commercial concerns prior to the war had
been building artillery wheels in limited quantities. One completely
new plant had to be erected for the manufacture of wheels,
while seven existing factories were specially equipped for this work.
We had to develop new sources of supply of oak and hickory and to
erect dry kilns especially for the wheel project.</p>

<p>The largest order for rubber tires in the history of the American
rubber industry was placed as one relatively small phase of the
artillery program, the order amounting to $4,250,000. Rubber tires
on the wheels of all the heavier types of artillery carriages, so that
the units might be drawn at good speed by motor vehicles, was
essentially an American innovation. No tires of this size had ever
been manufactured in this country. Consequently it was necessary
for the firms who got the orders to build machinery especially designed
for the purpose.</p>

<p>With practically all of the manufacturers of the American metal-working
industries clamoring for machine tools, and with some
branches of the Government commandeering the machine-tool shops
in whole sections of the country, it is evident that the necessity for
the heavier types of machine tools required by the manufacturers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
artillery material offered a weighty problem at the outset. In fact,
the machine-tool supply was never adequate at any time, and the
shortage of this machinery hampered and impeded to a great degree
the speed of our artillery production.</p>

<p>The Nation was raked with a fine-toothed comb for shop equipment.
The Government went to almost any honorable length to
procure this indispensable tooling. For instance, when the Dodge
plant at Detroit was being equipped to manufacture the 155-millimeter
recuperators, the Government agents discovered trainloads of
machinery consigned to the Russian government and awaiting
shipment. These tools were commandeered on the docks. One
huge metal planer had dropped overboard while it was being lightered
to the ocean tramp that was to carry it to a Russian port. Government
divers fixed grappling hooks to this machine, and it was brought
to the surface and shipped at once to the Dodge plant.</p>

<p>The 3-inch gun which we had been building for many years prior
to the war was a serviceable and efficient weapon; but still we were
unable to put it into production immediately as it was. Our earliest
divisions in France, under the international arrangement, were to be
equipped by the French with 75-millimeter guns; while we, on this
side of the water, reaching out for all designs of guns of proven worth,
expected to manufacture the 75's in large numbers in this country.
The French 75 in its barrel diameter is a fraction of an inch smaller
than our 3-inch gun, the exact equivalent of 75 millimeters being
2.95275 inches. Thus, if we built our own 3-inch gun (and the British
3.3-inch gun, as we intended) and also went ahead with the 75-millimeter
project on a great scale, we should be confronted by the
necessity of providing three sorts of ammunition of almost the same
size, with all the delays and confusion which such a situation would
imply. Consequently we decided to redesign the American and
British guns to make their bores uniformly 75 millimeters, thus
simplifying the ammunition problem and making available to us in
case of shortage the supplies of shell of this size in France.</p>

<p>With all of the above considerations in mind, it is evident now,
and it was then, that we could not hope to equip our Army with
American-built artillery as rapidly as that Army could be collected,
trained, and sent to France; and this was particularly true when in
the spring of 1917 the Army policy was changed to give each 1,000,000
men almost twice as many field guns as our program had required
prior to that date. Consequently, when on June 27, 1917, the Secretary
of War directed the Chief of Ordnance to provide the necessary
artillery for the 2,000,000 men who were to be mobilized in 1917 and
the first half of 1918, the first thought of our officers was to find
outside supplies of artillery which we could obtain for an emergency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that would not be relieved until our new facilities had reached great
production.</p>

<p>We found this source in France. The French had long been the
leading people in Europe in the production of artillery, and even the
great demands of the war had not succeeded in utilizing the full
capacity of their old and new plants. Two days later, on June 29,
1917, the French high commissioner, by letter, offered us in behalf
of France a daily supply of five 75-millimeter guns and carriages,
beginning August 1, 1917. The French also offered at this time
to furnish us with 155-millimeter howitzers; and on August 19, 1917,
the French Government informed Gen. Pershing that each month,
beginning with September, he could obtain twelve 155-millimeter Filloux
guns and carriages from the French factories.</p>

<p>Before the signing of the armistice 75-millimeter guns to the number
of 3,068 had been ordered from the French, and of this number
1,828 had been delivered. Of 155-millimeter howitzers, 1,361 had
been ordered from the French and 772 delivered before November
11, 1918. Of 155-millimeter guns, 577 had been ordered from the
French and 216 delivered previous to the granting of the armistice.</p>

<p>From British plants we ordered 212 Vickers-type 8-inch howitzers,
and 123 had been delivered before the armistice had been signed;
while of 9.2-inch howitzers, Vickers model, 40 of an order for 132 had
been completed. In addition to this, 302 British 6-inch howitzers
were in manufacture in England for delivery to us by April 1, 1919.
These figures, with the exception of those relating to the order for
British 6-inch howitzers, do not include the arrangements being made
by this Government during the last few weeks of hostilities for additional
deliveries of foreign artillery.</p>

<p>As to our own manufacture of artillery, when we had conquered all
the difficulties&mdash;translated the drawings, built the new factories,
equipped them with machine tools and dies, gages, and other fixtures
needed by the metal workers, and had mobilized the skilled workers
themselves&mdash;we forged ahead at an impressive rate. When the armistice
was signed we were turning out 412 artillery units per month.
Compare this with Great Britain's 486 units per month in the fall of 1918
and measure our progress, remembering that England had approximately
three years' head start. Compare it with the French monthly
production of 659 units per month, and remember that France was
the greatest artillery builder in the world. When it came to the gun
bodies themselves we obtained a monthly output of 832, as against
Great Britain's 802 and France's 1,138. And our artillery capacity
was then, in the autumn of 1918, only coming into production.</p>

<p>In the war period&mdash;April 6, 1917, to November 11, 1918&mdash;we produced
2,008 complete artillery units, as against 11,056 turned out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
France and 8,065 completed by Great Britain in the same period.
In those 19 months we turned out 4,275 gun bodies, while in the same
months France produced 19,492 and Great Britain 11,852.</p>


<h4>THE 37-MILLIMETER INFANTRY FIELD GUNS</h4>

<p>The smallest weapon of all the field guns we built was the French
37-millimeter gun, the diameter of its bore being about 1&frac12; inches in
our measurements, the figure being 1.45669 inches. This was the
so-called infantry field gun, to be dragged along by foot soldiers when
they are making an advance. Its chief use in the war was in breaking
up the German concrete pill boxes, machine gun nests, and other
strong points of enemy resistance. In service it was manned by
infantrymen instead of artillerists, a crew of eight men handling each
weapon, the squad leader being the gunner. One of the men of the
crew was the loader, and he was likewise able to fire the piece. The
other six men served as assistants.</p>

<p>The 37-millimeter outfit as it exists to-day consists of the gun, with
a split trail, mounted on axle and wheels. By means of a trailer
attachment on the ammunition cart it can be drawn by one horse
or one mule. The ammunition cart itself is merely a redesigned
machine-gun ammunition vehicle. The wheels and axle can easily be
removed and left a short distance in the rear of the place where it is
desired to set up the gun. The whole outfit weighs only 340 pounds
and is about 6 feet long.</p>

<p>The gun rests on its front leg which is dropped to form a tripod with
the two legs of the split trail. The gun proper can be removed from
the trail and the sponge staff can be inserted in the barrel through
the opened breech. Two men can bear this part of the weapon in
advancing action. Two other men are able to carry the trail, when
its legs are locked together, while the four other members of the
squad bring along the boxes of ammunition.</p>

<p>The ammunition cart holds 14 ammunition boxes, each containing
16 rounds. A spare-parts case, strapped to the trail, contains a miscellaneous
assortment of such parts as can readily be handled in the
field. A tool kit in a canvas roll is also transported on the cart, along
with entrenching tools and other accessories.</p>

<p>Equipped with a telescopic sight for direct fire and a quadrant, or
collimating sight, for indirect fire, great accuracy is obtained by this
small piece of artillery. The length of the barrel of the gun proper
is 20 calibers, which means that it is 20 times 37 millimeters in
length, or about 29 inches. The length of the recoil when the gun is
fired is 8 inches.</p>

<p>Two types of ammunition were provided for this gun at first; but,
as the low-explosive type was not so effective as desired, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
abandoned entirely in favor of the high-explosive type contained in
a projectile weighing 1&frac14; pounds. This projectile is loaded with 240
grains of T. N. T. and detonated by a base percussion fuse. The range
of the gun is 3,500 meters, or considerably more than 2 miles. Only
three to six shots from this gun were found to be necessary to demolish
an enemy machine gun emplacement or other strongly held position.</p>

<p>In the great war the 37-millimeter gun found itself and proved its
usefulness. The original model had been designed at the Puteaux
Arsenal in France in 1885; but it was not until after 1914 that the
weapon was produced in quantities.</p>

<p>In this country we took up the production of 37-millimeter guns in
October, 1917. While our shops were tooling up for the effort, 620
of these weapons were purchased from the French and turned over to
the American Expeditionary Forces. For the purposes of greater
speed in manufacture our executives took the gun apart and divided
it into three groups, known as the barrel group, the breech group, and
the recoil group. Additional to these, as a manufacturing proposition,
were the axle and wheels and the trail.</p>

<p>The barrel group went to the Poole Engineering &amp; Machine Co., of
Baltimore, Md., who subcontracted for some of the parts to the Maryland
Pressed Steel Co., of Hagerstown, Md. The breech group was
manufactured by the Krasberg Manufacturing Co., of Chicago. The
C. H. Cowdrey Machine Works, of Fitchburg, Mass., turned out the
recoil mechanisms. The axles and wheels were built by the International
Harvester Co., of Chicago. The trails were turned out by
the Universal Stamping &amp; Manufacturing Co., also of Chicago.</p>

<p>When crated for overseas shipment, the gun, ammunition cart, and
all accessories, weighed 1,550 pounds and occupied about 15 cubic feet
of space.</p>

<p>The first delivery of completed 37-millimeter guns from our factories
was made in June, 1918, and at the cessation of hostilities manufacturers
were turning out the guns at the rate of 10 per day. Between
June and November 122 American-built 37-millimeter guns were
shipped abroad, and more were ready to be sent over when the armistice
was signed. The gun had been so successful in use abroad that
our original order of 1,200 had been increased to 3,217 before the
signing of the armistice, including the 620 purchased from the French.</p>

<p>The various groups of this gun were shipped to the plant of the
Maryland Pressed Steel Co., Hagerstown, Md., for assembly and were
there tested at a specially built proving ground, 8 miles from the
factory.</p>

<p>Three 37's were issued to each infantry regiment, making one for
each battalion. The required equipment for a division was, therefore,
12 weapons.</p>

<h4>THE 75-MILLIMETER GUNS.</h4>

<p>Next in order in the upward scale of sizes we come to the 75-millimeter
gun, which was by far the most useful and most used piece of
artillery in the great war. In fact the American artillery program
might be divided in two classes, the 75's in one class, and all other
sizes in the other, since it may be said practically that for every gun
of another size produced we also turned out a 75. In number the 75's
made up almost half of our field artillery. The 75-millimeter gun
threw projectiles weighing between 12 and 16 pounds and it had an
effective range of over 5&frac12; miles.</p>

<p>We approached the war production of this weapon with three types
available for us to produce&mdash;our own 3-inch gun; its British cousin
the 3.3-inch gun or 18-pounder; and the French 75-millimeter gun,
with its bore of 2.95275 inches. The decision to adopt the 75-millimeter
size and modify the other two guns to this dimension, giving us
interchangeability of ammunition with the French, was an historic
episode in the American ordnance development of 1917.</p>

<p>While in 1917 the French with their excess manufacturing capacity
began work on our first orders for 1,068 guns of this size to supply our
troops during the interim until American factories could come into
production, we were preparing our factories for the effort. Roughly
speaking the 75 consists of a cannon mounted on a two-wheeled support
for transportation purposes. This support also provides a
means for aiming by suitable elevating and traverse mechanisms.
As previously explained, a recoil mechanism is also provided to
absorb the shock of firing, allowing a certain retrograde movement
of the cannon and then returning it in position for the next shot&mdash;returning
it "into battery," as the artillerists say. By its recuperator
device the field gun of to-day is chiefly distinguished from its brother
of the latter part of the nineteenth century. Without a recuperator
the gun would leap out of aim at each shot and would have to be
pointed anew; but one with a recuperator needs to be pointed only at
the beginning of the action.</p>

<p>When we entered the war we found ourselves with an equipment
of 544 field guns of the old 3-inch model of 1902. This gun had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
carriage provided with the old-style single trail. By 1913, however,
we had been experimenting with the split trail and it had been
strongly recommended by our ordnance experts; and in 1916 we had
placed orders for nearly 300 carriages of the split-trail type, which
had come to be known as Model 1916. Of these orders 96 carriages
were to come from the Bethlehem Steel Co., and the remainder
from the Rock Island Arsenal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile for some time the Bethlehem Steel Co. had been
engaged in turning out carriages for the British 3.3-inch guns. Here
was capacity that might be utilized to the limit; and, accordingly,
in May, 1917, we ordered from the Bethlehem Co. 268 of the British
carriages. At the same time we ordered from the same company
approximately 340 of our own Model 1916 carriages at a cost of
$3,319,800. A few weeks later the decision had been made to make
all our guns of this sort conform to the French 75-millimeter size,
and these British and American carriages contracted for in May
were ordered modified to take 75-millimeter guns. The carriages
needed little modification and the guns not much. Subsequently,
in rapid succession we placed orders with the Bethlehem Steel Co.,
calling for the construction of an additional 1,130 of the British carriages,
all of them to be adapted to 75-millimeter guns.</p>

<p>Next it was the concern of the Ordnance Department to find other
facilities for manufacturing carriages for these weapons. The
artillery committee of the Council of National Defense located the
New York Air Brake Co. as a concern willing to undertake this work;
and in June, 1917, this company signed a contract to produce 400
American model 1916 carriages at a cost of $3,250,000.</p>

<p>By December we had the drawings for the French carriages of
this size and made a contract with the Willys-Overland Motor Car
Co. to produce 2,927 of them. The table at the end of this section
shows the production attained at these various plants.</p>

<p>The manufacture of carriages for the 75's produced concrete
results, as our factories here were turning them out for us at the rate
of 393 per month when the fighting ceased, and our contract plants
in France were making 171 per month. In all we received from
American factories 1,221 carriages. At the rate of increase we
would have been building 800 carriages per month by February, 1919.</p>

<p>It may be said we were thoroughly impressed with the difficulties
attached to the transplanting to this country of the manufacture of
French 75-millimeter recuperators. It was a question whether this
device could possibly be built by any except the French mechanics
trained by long years in its production. At first it seemed that we
could secure no manufacturer at all who would be willing to assume
such a burden. Not until February, 1918, were complete drawings
and specifications of the recuperator received from France. At
length the Singer Manufacturing Co., builders of sewing machines,
consented to take up this new work, and on March 29 the company
contracted to produce 2,500 recoil systems for the 75-millimeter gun
carriages. In April, 1918, the Rock Island Arsenal was instructed
to turn out 1,000 of these recuperators.</p>

<p>This type of gun has been used by the French Army since 1897, and was the gun most used
by the Allies in the Great War. This gun throws a shell weighing 12.3 pounds a distance
of 8,400 meters or shrapnel weighing 16 pounds a distance of 9,000 meters. The weight
of the gun and carriage is 2,657 pounds. The service muzzle velocity of the shell is 1,805

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The production of gun bodies for the 75-millimeter units was
quite satisfactory. The Bethlehem Co., the Wisconsin Gun Co.,
the Symington-Anderson Co., and the Watervliet Arsenal were the
contractors who built the gun bodies. Gun bodies of three types,
but all of the same 75-millimeter bore, were ordered&mdash;the American
type (the modified 3-inch gun), the British type (the modified
3.3-inch gun), and the French type.</p>

<p>Our ordnance preparation would have given us enough 75's for the
projected army of 3,360,000 men on the front in the summer of
1919, together with appropriate provision for training in the United
States. Of the 75's built in this country, 143 units were shipped
to the American Expeditionary Forces before the armistice went
into effect. Meanwhile the French had delivered to our troops
1,828 units of this size. The total equipment of 75's for our Army
in France from all sources thus amounted to 1,971 guns with their
complete accessories.</p>

<h4>4.7-INCH GUNS.</h4>

<p>In the 4.7-inch field gun, model of 1906, America took to France a
weapon all her own. It was a proven gun, too, developed under
searching experiments and tests. There were 60 of these in actual
service when we got into the war. The 4.7-inch guns, with their
greater range and power, promised to be particularly useful for
destroying the enemy's 77-millimeter guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The carriage model of 1906 for the 4.7-inch gun is of the long recoil
type, the recoil being 70 inches in length. The recoil is checked by
a hydraulic cylinder, and a system of springs thereupon returns the
gun to the firing position. The gun's maximum elevation is 15
degrees, at which elevation, with a 60-pound projectile, the gun has a
range of 7,260 meters, or 4&frac12; miles. With a 45-pound projectile a
range of 8,750 meters, or nearly 5&frac12; miles, can be obtained at 15
degrees elevation. It is possible to increase this range to about
10,000 meters, or well over 6 miles, by depressing the trail into a hole
prepared for it, a practice often adopted on the field to obtain greater
range. The total weight of the gun carriage with its limber is about
9,800 pounds.</p>

<p>An order for 250 of the 4.7-inch carriages was placed with the
Walter Scott Co., at Plainfield, N. J., July 12, 1917, upon the
recommendation of committees of the Council of National Defense,
who were assisting the Ordnance Department in the selection of
industrial firms willing to accept artillery contracts. Of the 250
ordered from this concern, 49 were delivered up to the signing of
the armistice.</p>

<p>The Rock Island Arsenal had also been employed previously in
turning out 4.7-inch carriages; and the capacity of that plant,
although small, was utilized. Under the date of July 23, 1917, the
arsenal was instructed to deliver 183 carriages. Late in December,
1917, the Studebaker Corporation was given an order for 500. On
September 30, 1918, Rock Island Arsenal was given an additional
order for 120 carriages, while the Studebaker order was reduced to
380. Additional plant facilities had to be provided at both the
Walter Scott Co. and the Studebaker Corporation.</p>

<p>Up to December 12, 1918, a total of 381 carriages of the 4.7-inch
type had been completed and delivered. These carriages included
the recoil mechanism. In the month of October, 1918, alone, 113
were produced, and this rate would have been continued had the
armistice not been signed.</p>

<p>Cannon for the 4.7-inch units were turned out at the Watervliet
Arsenal and the Northwestern Ordnance Co., Madison, Wis. Deliveries
from the Watervliet Arsenal began in June, 1918, totaling
120 up to December, while the Northwestern Ordnance Co., starting
its deliveries in August, had completed 98 by December.</p>

<p>Up to the 15th of November, 64 complete 4.7-inch units had been
floated for our forces overseas.</p>

<p>Forgings for the 4.7-inch gun cannon were made by the Bethlehem
Steel Co. and the Heppenstall Forge &amp; Knife Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>

<p>Owing to the great difference in cross section between muzzle and
breech end of the jacket, great difficulty was experienced in the
heat treatment of these forgings, particularly on the part of manufacturers
who had had no previous experience in the production of
gun forgings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to produce enough forgings to supply the finish-machining
shops, an order for 50 jackets was later given to the Edgewater Steel
Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa., where the jackets were forged. These were
then sent to the Heppenstall Forge &amp; Knife Co. for rough machining
and finally returned to the Edgewater Steel Co. for heat treating.
An order for 150 jackets was also given to the Tacony Ordnance
Corporation.</p>

<p>Shortly before the signing of the armistice, the jacket was redesigned
so that the heavy breech end was forged separately in the
shape of a breech ring. This design, however, was not produced.</p>

<p>It was desired to develop a 4.7-inch gun carriage having the
characteristics of the split-trail 75-millimeter gun carriage, model of
1916, so that greater elevation and wide traverse could be obtained.
The Bethlehem Steel Co. was given a small order for 36 carriages of
their own design prior to the war, and their pilot carriage had been
undergoing tests at the proving ground. The design was, however,
not sufficiently advanced to be used in the war.</p>

<h4>THE 5-INCH AND 6-INCH GUN MOUNTS.</h4>

<p>In the war emergency America sought to put on the front every
pound of artillery she could acquire from any source whatsoever.
Accordingly, before any of the manufacturing projects were even
started, the Ordnance Department conducted a preparedness inventory
of the United States to see what guns already in existence we
might find that could be improvised for use as mobile artillery in
France. The search discovered a number of heavy cannon that
could serve the purpose&mdash;part of them belonging to the Army, these
being the guns at our seacoast fortifications; part belonging to the
Navy, in its stores of supplies for battleships; and part of them being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the property of a private dealer, Francis Bannerman &amp; Son, of New
York.</p>

<p>The guns for this improvised use were obtained as follows:</p>

<p>From the Coast Artillery, a branch of the Army, we obtained
ninety-five 6-inch guns, 50 calibers in length, and twenty-eight 5-inch
guns, 44.6 calibers; from the Navy stores came forty-six 6-inch guns,
ranging from 30 to 50 calibers in length; from Francis Bannerman
&amp; Son, thirty 6-inch guns, 30 calibers long. This was a total of 199
weapons of great destructive power, awaiting only suitable mobile
mounts to make them of valiant service on the western front. It was
the task of the Ordnance Department to take these guns and as
swiftly as possible mount them on field artillery carriages of an
improvised type that could be most quickly built.</p>

<p>Minor changes had to be made on many of the guns obtained in
this manner in order to adapt them for use on field artillery carriages.
The various seacoast guns were retained as they were in length,
because it was planned to return them eventually to the fortifications
from which they had been taken. The Navy guns, all of the 6-inch
size, were shipped to the Watervliet Arsenal to be cut down to a
uniform length of 30 calibers.</p>

<p>The need for speed in manufacture demanded that the carriages
for these guns should be of the simplest design consistent with the
ruggedness required for field operations and the accuracy necessary
for effectiveness. When tests of the first carriages produced were
made it was found that requirements had been more than met.</p>

<p>Orders were placed on September 24, 1917, with the Morgan
Engineering Co., of Alliance, Ohio, for 70 mounts for the 6-inch
units. A few days later this number was increased to 74, while on
the 28th of September, 1917, the same company was given an order
for 18 additional 6-inch gun mounts and 28 mounts for the 5-inch
guns. Orders for limbers were placed with the same company on
December 1.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that big transport wagons would be required
to carry the long 6-inch seacoast guns separately because of their
great weight. On February 15, 1918, the Morgan Engineering Co.
was ordered to build these necessary transport wagons.</p>

<p>Difficulties in securing skilled labor, necessary materials, and tools
delayed production of these mounts, but the eighteen 6-inch gun
mounts ordered September 28, 1917, were completed in March,
1918, while the twenty-eight 5-inch gun mounts ordered on the same
date were finished in April. In August, 1918, the seventy-four
6-inch gun mounts were turned out. The production of an additional
order for thirty-seven 6-inch gun mounts was just beginning
when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The 6-inch gun carriage, bearing the gun, weighs about 41,000
pounds. A maximum range of over 10 miles can be obtained by
this weapon. The complete 5-inch gun unit weighs about 23,500
pounds and has a maximum range of more than 9 miles. In understanding
the difficulties that faced the Ordnance Department in
building carriages for these guns, it should be recalled that these
big weapons were originally built for fixed-emplacement duty and
were therefore much heavier than mobile types. This fact complicated
the problem of designing the wheeled mounts. They proved
to be more difficult to maneuver than the lighter types of guns.</p>

<h4>155-MILLIMETER HOWITZERS.</h4>

<p>It is a testimonial to the adaptability and skill of American
industry that we were able to duplicate successfully in this country
the celebrated 155-millimeter howitzer, before 1917 built only in
the factory of its original designer, the great firm of Schneider et
Cie., in France. This powerful weapon is a fine example of the French
gun builders' art, in a country where the art of gun-making has been
carried to a perfection unknown anywhere else.</p>

<p>The 155-millimeter howitzer's history dates back to the nineteenth
century. In its development the French designers had so
strengthened its structure, increased its range, and improved its
general serviceability, that in 1914 it was ready to take its place as
one of the two most-used and best-known weapons of the allies, the
other being the 75-millimeter field gun.</p>

<p>As thus perfected the howitzer weighs less than 4 tons and is
extremely mobile for a weapon of its size. It can hurl a 95-pound
projectile well over 7 miles and fire several times a minute. The
rapidity of fire is made possible by a hydropneumatic recoil system
that supports the short barrel of the gun and stores up the energy
of the recoil by the compression of air. With the gun pointing
upward at an angle of 45 degrees, the recoil mechanism will restore
it into battery in less than 13 seconds. The carriage of the gun is
extremely light, being built of pressed steel parts that incorporate
many ingenious features of design to reduce the weight. The shell
and the propelling charge of powder are loaded separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The American-built 155-millimeter howitzer was practically identical
with that built in France. Any of the important parts of the
American weapon would interchange with those which had come from
the Schneider factory. We equipped the wheels of our field carriage,
however, with rubber tires, and gave the gun a straight shield of
armor plate instead of a curved shield.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 we bought the plans of the howitzer from
Schneider et Cie. and began at once the work of translating the specifications
into American measurements. This work monopolized the
efforts of an expert staff until October 8, 1917.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the reproduction here, we divided the
weapon, as a manufacturing proposition, into three groups&mdash;the
cannon itself, the carriage, and the recuperator or recoil system&mdash;and
placed each group in the hands of separate contractors. There
was, of course, the usual difficulty in finding manufacturers willing
to undertake production of such an intricate device and who also
possessed machine shops that had the equipment and talent required
for such work, and in procuring for these shops the highly specialized
machinery that would be necessary.</p>

<p>The American Brake Shoe &amp; Foundry Co., of Erie, Pa., whose
magnificent work in building a special plant has been described in
the preceding chapter, took an order in August, 1917, for 3,000
howitzer cannon and by October, 1918, was producing 12 of them
every day. The company turned out its first cannon in February,
1918, approximately six months after receiving the contract, having
in the interim built and equipped a most elaborate plant. It is
doubtful if the annals of industry in any country can produce a feat
to match this.</p>

<p>In fact, the production of cannon by the Erie concern so outstripped
the manufacture of carriages and other important parts for
the howitzer that it was possible by September, 1918, for us to sell
550 howitzer bodies to the French Government. When the armistice
was signed on November 11, 1918, the company had completed
1,172 cannon.</p>

<p>In November, 1917, we placed orders for 2,469 carriages for this
weapon, splitting the order between the Osgood-Bradley Car Co.,
of Worcester, Mass., and the Mosler Safe Co., of Hamilton, Ohio.
Then followed a long battle to secure the tools and equipment, the
skilled mechanical labor, and the necessary quantities of the best
grades of steel and bronze, an effort in which the contracting companies
were at all times aided by the engineers of the Ordnance
Department. All obstacles were overcome and the first carriages
were ready for testing in June, 1918. When the armistice was
signed 154 carriages had been delivered, and production was moving
so rapidly that one month later this number had been run up to 230.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The limbers were manufactured by the Maxwell Motor Car Co.,
which had orders to turn out 2,575 of them. The first deliveries of
limbers came in September, 1918, and seven a day were being turned
out in October, a total of 273 having been completed by the day of the
armistice. A month later the number of completed limbers totaled
587.</p>

<p>It was in the making of the recuperator systems that the greatest
problems were presented. No mechanism at all similar to this had
ever been made in this country. No plant was in existence here capable
of turning out such a highly complicated, precise, and delicate
device.</p>

<p>Finally, after much Governmental search and long negotiation, the
Dodge Bros., of Detroit, motor car builders, agreed to accept the
responsibility. In this effort they built and equipped the splendid
factory, costing $10,000,000, described elsewhere.</p>

<p>This howitzer recuperator is turned out from a solid forging,
weighing 3,875 pounds, but the completed recuperator weighs only
870 pounds. Each cylinder must be bored, ground, and lapped to
a degree of fineness and accuracy that requires the most painstaking
care.</p>

<p>Difficulties of almost every sort were experienced with the forgings
and other elements of the recuperators. The steel was analyzed
and its metallurgical formulas were changed. The work of machining
proceeded favorably until the very last operation&mdash;that of polishing
the interior of the long bores to a mirrorlike glaze and still retaining
the extreme accuracy necessary to prevent the leakage of oil past
the pistons. Such precision had been theretofore unknown in
American heavy manufacture. Until the many processes could be
perfected, the deliveries were held back.</p>

<p>Even with the delivery of the first recuperator, difficulties did not
vanish. This mechanism has no adjustments which can be made
on the field, but depends for its wonderful operation upon the extreme
nicety of the relation of its parts. It required the alteration of certain
small parts before the first trial models could be made to function.</p>

<p>However, all obstacles and difficulties were finally overcome, and
in the plant that had been erected during the bitter cold of one of
our severest winters, and with practically entirely new machinery
and workmen, production got under way, and the first recuperator
was delivered early in July, 1918, nine months after the contract
was signed. Production in quantity began to follow shortly after
that month, and by November an average of 16 recuperators a day
was being turned out. Of the 3,120 recuperators contracted for,
898 had been finished when the armistice was signed, and this
quantity was increased to 1,238 one month later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The steel required for the recuperators in these 155-millimeter
howitzers, and also for those of the 155-millimeter guns, was of
special composition; yet all the forge capacity in this country was
being utilized in other war manufacture. New facilities for the
manufacture of these forgings had to be developed by increasing the
capacity of the Mesta Machine Co. of Pittsburgh, until it could meet
our requirements. The Government itself contracted for these
forgings and supplied them to Dodge Bros.</p>

<p>Each howitzer required some 200 items of miscellaneous equipment,
such as air and liquid pumps and other tools. These were
purchased from many sources, and many of these contractors had
just as much difficulty with the small parts as the larger firms had
with the more important sections of the howitzers.</p>

<p>Many of the problems involved in turning out the complete unit
could not be known or understood until they were met with in actual
manufacture. Mechanical experts representing Schneider et Cie.
were on hand at all times to help solve difficulties as they arose.</p>

<p>The Government turned to France for an auxiliary supply of carriages
for the American-built howitzers, placing orders for 1,361 with
French concerns. Of this number 772 had been completed when the
armistice was signed, and the French expected soon to turn out the
carriages at the rate of 140 per month. It might also be noted here
that we placed an order in England for 302 British 6-inch howitzers,
a piece very like the French howitzer. The British contract was to
be completed April 1, 1919.</p>

<p>The various parts of the 155-millimeter howitzer were assembled
into complete units and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
After being assembled and tested, the whole unit was taken apart
and packed into crates especially designed for overseas shipment.
One crate held two howitzer carriages with recuperators in less space
than would have been occupied by one carriage on its wheels.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the first gun body of the 155-millimeter howitzers
made in this country was delivered in February and the first
recuperator in July. Before the recuperators were ready, the other
parts of the howitzer had been proof-tried by using a recuperator of
French manufacture.</p>

<p>During the months of August and September, 1918, the first regiment
equipped with 155-millimeter howitzers was made ready at
Aberdeen. The big weapons were packed and on the dock for shipment
overseas when the armistice was signed. These first ones were
to be followed by a steady stream of howitzers. All arrangements
had been made to assemble units and crate them for overseas at the
Erie Proving Ground at Port Clinton, Ohio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the 155-millimeter howitzers built here reached the American
Expeditionary Forces, but French deliveries of the weapon up to
the signing of the armistice totaled 747.</p>

<h4>THE 155-MILLIMETER G. P. F. GUNS.</h4>

<p>The reproduction in the United States of the French 155-millimeter
G. P. F. (the French designation) gun presents much the same story
as that of the howitzer of equal size&mdash;a story of difficulties in translating
plans, writing into them the precision of finishing measurements
that the French factory usually leaves to the skill of the
mechanic himself, difficulties in finding manufacturers willing to undertake
the work, and then of providing them with suitable raw
materials and machinery, and, above all, of locating the necessary
skilled mechanics.</p>

<p>This strange, big monster of a weapon is of rugged design. The
entire unit weighs 19,860 pounds. The gun has the extremely
high muzzle velocity of 2,400 feet per second, a rate of propulsion
that throws the 95-pound projectile 17,700 yards, or a little more
than 10 miles.</p>

<p>The wheels of the carriage have a double tread of solid rubber tire.
By an ingenious arrangement a caterpillar tread can be applied to
the wheels in a few minutes whenever soft ground is encountered.</p>

<p>The center of gravity of the unit is low. The wheels are of small
dimensions and the cradle is trunnioned behind in such a fashion as
to reduce the height of the cannon. The carriage has a split trail,
which allows for a large clearance for recoil at a high elevation
and a large angle of traverse. The carriage when traveling is supported
on semielliptical springs, as is also the carriage limber.</p>

<p>Two large steel castings make up the carriage of this unit. The
bottom part of the carriage is supported by the axle, which carries
the two sections of the split trail upon the hinge pins. The top part
of the carriage is supported by and revolves upon the bottom carriage
and carries in trunnioned bearings the recuperator. The prin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>cipal
difficulty in carriage manufacture was to obtain in this country
the extremely large steel castings of light-section, high-grade steel.</p>

<p>The carriages, 1,388 in number, were ordered in November, 1917,
from the Minneapolis Steel &amp; Machinery Co. The first delivery of
carriages was made in August, 1918, and in the last week of October
they were being turned out at the rate of seven a day. Up to the
armistice date 370 had been produced, of which 16 had been sent
overseas.</p>

<p>We also placed orders in France for 577 of these carriages, of which
216 had been completed upon the signing of the armistice. The
American monthly rate of production of carriages in October was 162.</p>

<p>The 155-millimeter gun itself is far from being simple to manufacture.
It is of considerable length and is built of a number of jackets
and hoops to give the required resistance to the heavy pressures
exerted in firing, this being a high-velocity gun. Except for
a slight change in the manner of locking the hoops to the jacket, our
gun is identical with that of the French.</p>

<p>Orders for 2,160 cannon were given to the Watervliet Arsenal and
the Bullard Engineering Works, at Bridgeport, Conn., in November,
1917. The Bullard Engineering Works had to construct new buildings
and to purchase and install special equipment, and the Watervliet
Arsenal had to extend its shops and also purchase and install
much additional machinery&mdash;a job that took time at both places.</p>

<p>The first deliveries of cannon came from Watervliet Arsenal in
July, 1918. During October 50 cannon were delivered, and it seemed
certain that by early in 1919 the projected eight cannon per day
would be the rate attained. We shipped 16 of the cannon overseas.
By November 11 we had received 71 cannon, a number increased to
109 by December 12.</p>

<p>Limbers in the same quantity as carriages were ordered from the
Minneapolis Steel &amp; Machinery Co., which produced a limber to accompany
each one of its delivered carriages. This limber has an
extremely heavy axle, similar to the automobile front axle. Its size
and weight caused difficulty in obtaining it as a drop forging.</p>

<p>To Dodge Bros. was assigned the task of producing the recuperators
for this gun in their special plant. The 155-millimeter gun recuperators,
however, were made secondary to the production of the
recuperators for the 155-millimeter howitzers, which were the easier
of the two sorts to build.</p>

<p>Forgings were available and work started on recuperators in April,
1918. No rapid completion of these intricate mechanisms was possible,
however, as the first forgings encountered many delays in their
machinings. In the cycle of operations, with everything speeded up
to the limit, more than three months must elapse from the day the
recuperator forging is received to the day when the completed mechanism
can be turned over to the inspector as an assembled article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in October, 1918, that the first 155-millimeter gun recuperator
was delivered. The factory expected to reach a maximum
capacity of 10 a day. The company built 12 more by December 1.
After the armistice was signed the company's order was reduced to
880, which had all been completed by May 1, 1919.</p>

<p>In order to have recuperators available for use for the units shipped
from the United States minus these mechanisms, 110 rough-machined
recuperator forgings were shipped to France, where the work of
machining and completing was done.</p>

<p>The translation of the French plans for this weapon furnished one
of the most difficult pieces of work undertaken by the Ordnance
Department. Without counting in the gun pieces, the carriage and
limber is made up of 479 pieces, while the recoil mechanism itself has
372 pieces. A total of 150 mechanical tracings had to be made by
our draftsmen for the carriage and test tools; 50 for the carriage
limbers; 142 for the recoil mechanism; 74 for the tools and accessories;
or a total of 416. It was extremely difficult to secure draftsmen
who could do this work, and the translation, accomplished in a
few weeks, is regarded as a remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>The cannon for this gun were tested at the Erie Proving Grounds
and there packed for overseas shipment. We had many cannon and
carriages awaiting shipment when the armistice was signed, the plan
being to send them to France, where they would be equipped with
recuperators.</p>

<h4>8-INCH HOWITZERS</h4>

<p>In the early days of the war the British designed an 8-inch field
howitzer that proved itself on battle fields in France. Great Britain
loaded her own plants with orders for this weapon and then turned
to the United States for additional facilities. The Midvale Steel &amp;
Ordnance Co. at Nicetown, Pa., was manufacturing this unit for the
British at the time we entered the war.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1917, exactly eight days after we had formally
announced our purpose of warring with Germany, an order for 80
of these 8-inch howitzers was placed with the Midvale Steel Co. It
was understood that production on our order was to be begun upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the completion of the British contract on which the Midvale Co.
was then engaged. The order included the complete units, with
carriages, limbers, tools, and accessories, all to be built in accordance
with British specifications.</p>

<p>Contracts for the trails were sublet by the Midvale Co. to the
Cambria Steel Co; for the wheels, to the American Road &amp; Machinery
Co.; for the limbers and firing platforms, to the J. G. Brill Co.; and
for the open sights, to the British-American Manufacturing Co.
Panoramic sights for these guns were furnished by the Frankford
Arsenal.</p>

<p>So satisfactory did the production proceed that on December 13,
1917, the first of the 8-inch howitzers was proof-tried with good
results. Early in January, 1918, the complete units began to come
through at the rate of three a week, increasing to four a week in April
and to six a week in May.</p>

<p>A subsequent contract with Midvale brought the total number of
howitzers ordered from that plant up to 195. These weapons, all of
the model known as the Mark VI, were all produced and accepted
before the signing of the armistice, 96 of them being shipped overseas,
with their full complement of accessories. Each completed
unit cost in the neighborhood of $55,000. These weapons throw a
200-pound projectile 11,750 yards.</p>

<p>The progress of the war moved so swiftly, however, that there soon
was need for artillery units of this same size but with longer range.
Accordingly, a new design, known as the Mark VIII&frac12;, was brought
out, having a range of over 13,000 yards. On October 2, 1918, we
placed with the Midvale Co. an order for 100 of these 8-inch howitzers,
specifying carriages of the new, heavier type.</p>

<p>When we entered the war the Bethlehem Steel Co., at Bethlehem,
Pa., was producing for the British Government a howitzer with a
bore of 9.2 inches. The Bethlehem Co. expected to complete these
British contracts in July, 1917. The 9.2-inch howitzer was approximately
the same size as the 240-millimeter howitzer which we were
getting ready to put into production. However, in our desire to
utilize every bit of the production facilities of the country, we
ordered 100 of the 9.2-inch howitzer units from the Bethlehem Steel
Co. and placed additional orders for 132 of these units in England.
The British concerns delivered 40 howitzers before the armistice
was signed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE 240-MILLIMETER HOWITZERS.</h4>

<p>The scheme of production of the French 240-millimeter howitzers
was entirely aimed at the year 1919; since even if American heavy
manufacturing establishments had not been loaded with war orders,
it would have been well-nigh impossible to turn out this mighty
engine of destruction in quantities in any shorter period of time.</p>

<p>Although approximately the same size as the British 9.2-inch
howitzer (the exact diameter of the bore of the 240 being 9.45
inches) and only a little larger than the 8-inch howitzer, the French
gun was far more powerful than either. The 8-inch and the 9.2-inch
howitzers had ranges in the neighborhood of 6 miles, while their
shell weighed from 200 to 290 pounds. The 240, on the other hand,
hurled a shell weighing 356 pounds and carrying a bursting charge
of between 45 and 50 pounds of high explosive. Its range was
almost 10 miles.</p>

<p>We produced the 8-inch and the 9.2-inch howitzers to fill the
gap during the two years which must elapse before we could get into
quantity production of the 240. The French and British governments
in the fall of 1917 asserted their ability to equip our first 30
combat divisions in 1918 with heavy howitzers, so that if our production
came along in the spring of 1919 it could meet the requirements
of the war situation.</p>

<p>Consequently we planned to equip our first army of 30 divisions
with 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers in equal numbers of each. Our
second army of 30 divisions should be wholly equipped with 240-millimeter
howitzers; and our expected production of these, being
beyond our own contemplated needs, would serve to replace such
8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers as had been lost in the meantime.</p>

<p>As we adapted it from the French Schneider model, the 240-millimeter
howitzer consisted of four main parts&mdash;the howitzer barrel,
the top carriage, the cradle with recoil and mechanism, and the
firing platform. Each of these four parts had its own transportation
wagon and limber drawn by a 10-ton tractor. The weapon was set
up with the aid of an erecting frame and a small hand crane.</p>

<p>Each of the main sections is composed of numerous smaller assembled
parts made up of various grades of iron and steel and raw
materials, all requiring the greatest precision in their manufacture
and all having to pass rigid and exacting tests for strength and
dimensions.</p>

<p>The production of even one of these enormous weapons would have
been a hard job for any American industrial plant, but to manufacture
over 1,200 of them, and that within the comparatively limited
time allowed and under the abnormal industrial and transportation
conditions then prevailing, was a task of tremendous difficulty and
complexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>On September 1, 1917, an order was placed with the Watertown
Arsenal for 250 carriages for the American 240's, to be turned out
complete with the recoil mechanism, transportation vehicles, tools,
and accessories. To show the size of the job, an allotment of
$17,450,000 was set aside to cover the estimated expenses at the
arsenal.</p>

<p>Well equipped as the Watertown Arsenal was said to be at the time
for the production of heavy gun carriages, it was found necessary, in
order to handle this job, to construct a new erecting shop that had
a capacity practically as large as all the other buildings of the plant
put together. The number of employees at the arsenal was increased
from 1,200 to more than 3,000.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty experienced was in obtaining the large
number of heavy machine tools required, and experts were sent out
to scour the country in an effort to locate these tools wherever they
might be available. Raw materials could not be procured in sufficient
quantities, while numerous transportation delays impeded the
work.</p>

<p>Finally, in October, 1918, the pilot carriage was completed and
sufficient progress had been made on the entire contract to assure
production of the required number of units in the early part of 1919.</p>

<p>A second carriage contract (Nov. 16, 1917) went to the
Standard Steel Car Co., of Hammond, Ind. This called for the
delivery of 964 carriages complete with transportation vehicles,
limbers, tools, etc., but not with recuperators. These the Otis
Elevator Co., of New York, undertook to deliver.</p>

<p>The Standard Steel Car Co. is one of the most important builders of
railway cars, freight and passenger, in the country, and it possessed
a large and well-equipped plant. Nevertheless, the company was
compelled to construct several additional buildings and practically
to double the capacity of its huge erecting shop in order to prepare
adequately for the tremendous task undertaken.</p>

<p>As a means to save time, subcontracts were immediately placed
with more than 100 firms throughout the East and Middle West for
the production and machining of as many as possible of the component
parts needed by the Standard Steel Car Co. Wherever practicable,
the subcontractors working on similar contracts for the
Watertown Arsenal were retained by the Indiana company, so that
better prices might be obtained, parts standardized, and the whole
production greatly facilitated.</p>

<p>Once the work was well under way the ramifications of this one
contract, with its subcontracts for parts, materials, tools, building
construction, etc., extended throughout practically the entire industrial
facilities of the eastern and central sections of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>As in the case of the contract given the Watertown Arsenal, there
were many difficulties in obtaining tools and raw materials. In a
large majority of cases allocations, partly of iron and steel products,
had to be obtained through the War Industries Board. When
allocations had been granted, priority orders had to be secured, as
the producers of these materials were already overworked with
Government orders of varying importance.</p>

<p>With the pilot carriage complete in the early part of October, production
on all the main parts had progressed by November to such
an extent that a large output of finished carriages was assured for
December and thereafter, had not the signing of the armistice intervened
and ended the necessity for further expedition of the work.</p>

<p>The Watervliet Arsenal on November 20, 1917, was instructed to
do the machining of forgings so as to turn out 250 gun bodies for
the 240-millimeter howitzers, and three months later this order
was doubled. On November 7, 1918, an additional 660 were ordered
from Watervliet, making a grand total of 1,160 howitzer cannon
of this caliber ordered machined and completed at the Watervliet
Arsenal. The arsenal contracted to reach an output of 100 cannon
a month and deliver the last of the 1,160 not later than September
30, 1919.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to erect an entirely new shop for the machining
of these howitzers. This shop was completed in May, 1918.
During the war period $13,164,706 was spent or allotted to the Watervliet
Arsenal for increasing its facilities. Forgings were furnished to
the arsenal by the Government, but the forging situation was never
a delaying factor in the production of 240-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p>In all, 158 sets, of 1,467 ordered, were delivered up to December
12, 1918. The pilot howitzer was delivered by the Watervliet Arsenal
to the proving ground on August 24, 1918.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1918 the Watertown Arsenal contracted to build
252 additional recuperators for these howitzers. Work was started at
once in the shops, and, though additional facilities had to be prepared
and much new equipment added, the production of the first recuperator
was begun without delay. It was found that the planing
equipment at the arsenal was not sufficient to handle the work, and
therefore a great deal of the rough planing was done by subcontractors.</p>

<p>The Watertown Arsenal was to furnish its own forgings, but it was
quickly found that an additional source of supplies was required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The Carnegie Steel Co. had been given an order on December 27, 1917,
for 1,300 recuperator forgings, and some of these were sent to the
Watertown Arsenal.</p>

<p>The first recuperator was completed October 28, 1918, and 16 had
been finished up to December 31, 1918, when 280 forgings were in
the process of machining.</p>

<p>To handle its order for 1,039 recuperators, the Otis Elevator Co.,
of New York, found it necessary to rebuild a plant which it owned in
Chicago. Forgings were furnished by the Government.</p>

<p>On May 1, 1918, the Otis Elevator Co. started its rough machining.
Hard spots were found in the metal, causing great trouble at first,
but this difficulty was overcome by changes in the heat treatment.
The Carnegie Steel Co. was then instructed to rough-machine the
forgings before sending them to the Otis Elevator Co. An order was
also given to the Midvale Steel Co. to rough-machine 24 forgings.
Early in November, 1918, the Otis Elevator Co. finished its first
recuperator.</p>

<p>One 240-millimeter howitzer unit was completed at the time of
the signing of the armistice, out of a total of 1,214 contracted for;
but had war conditions continued, the expectation was for a monthly
capacity of 80 units by 1919. Actual deliveries are given below:</p>

<h4>FIGHTING THE AIRPLANE WITH ARTILLERY.</h4>

<p>The American development of antiaircraft artillery had, previously
to 1917, been confined almost exclusively to the task of designing and
constructing stationary units of defense for our coast fortifications.
It was naturally expected that it would be at those points that we
would first, if ever, have to meet an attack from the air. Very little
attention had been paid mobile artillery of this sort.</p>

<p>Before April, 1916, the Ordnance Department had designed a high-powered
3-inch antiaircraft mount for the fixed emplacement at coast
fortifications. The gun on this mount fired a 15-pound projectile
with a muzzle velocity of 2,600 feet a second. It is still to-day the
most powerful antiaircraft weapon of its caliber. Between May, 1916,
and June 18, 1917, orders for 160 of these mounts were placed with
the Watertown Arsenal and the Bethlehem Steel Co. Up to April
10, 1919, a total of 116 of these had been completed and sent for emplacement
at the points selected.</p>

<p>By the end of 1916, however, it was foreseen that it would be necessary
to provide antiaircraft artillery of a mobile type as part of the
equipment for any field forces that might be sent abroad. Since that
contingency seemed entirely possible at that time, and as it appeared
to be impossible to provide a suitable design that would have a sufficient
period of time in which to get proper consideration and test, it
was decided to improvise a simple structural steel design that would
permit quick construction and on which a 75-millimeter field gun,
that was already in production, could be mounted.</p>

<p>This design was completed May 1, 1917, and an order for 50 placed
with the Builders Iron Foundry. Deliveries on these were made
during the fall of 1917, and the carriages were at once shipped to
France for equipment with French field guns and recuperators that
had been already procured for the purpose.</p>

<p>In its mobility the improvised antiaircraft gun mount was far from
perfect. It was necessary to disassemble it partly and mount it on
trailers. The need for a mount that could be moved easily and
speedily had been realized before our entrance in the war, and a design
embodying these qualities was completed as early as December,
1916.</p>

<p>This truck was designed to be equipped with the American 75-millimeter
field gun, model of 1916. Before the drawings were completed
an order for the pilot mounts of this type was placed with the
Rock Island Arsenal. The war came on, and it was decided not to
wait for a test of the mounts before starting general manufacture.
Accordingly the New Britain Machine Co., in July, 1917, was given
an order for 51 carriages. No further orders were placed for carriages
of this sort, as it was not thought best to go too heavily into
production of an untried mount.</p>

<p>It may be noted here that our first 26 antiaircraft guns were
mounted on White 1&frac12;-ton trucks.</p>

<p>It was also realized that the field guns with which these mounts were
to be equipped did not have the power and range that the war experience
was showing to be necessary. The only reasons that the field
guns of the 75-millimeter caliber were used in this way was because
they were the guns most quickly available and because the French
were already using them for this purpose.</p>

<p>To meet the need of more powerful antiaircraft weapons, a need
becoming more pressing each day, a 3-inch high-powered antiaircraft
gun was designed and mounted on a four-wheel trailer of the automobile
type. This mount permitted elevations of the gun from 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
degrees to 85 degrees and also allowed for "all around" firing. An
order for 612 of these carriages was given to the New Britain Machine
Co. in July, 1917, shortly after the contract for the 51 truck mounts
had been placed with that concern.</p>

<p>Because of the urgency of the situation it was necessary to construct
these carriages without the preliminary tests on a pilot carriage.
This, of course, is a very undesirable practice, but under the
existing conditions no other procedure would have been practicable.
The French antiaircraft auto truck mount, which had the French
75-millimeter field gun with its recuperator placed upon a special
antiaircraft mount, was not adopted at the time, because, in July,
1917, the whole question of the possibility of constructing French
recuperators in this country was still entirely unsettled. It was imperative
then that we develop our own designs.</p>

<p>All of the 51 truck mounts for the antiaircraft guns were delivered
during the fall and early winter of 1918, and 22 of them were in
France before December, 1918.</p>

<p>Delivery of the first carriage for the 3-inch high-powered gun
mounted on the trailer carriage was made in August, 1917. It had
been rushed ahead of general production in order to be given some
sort of a test. No further deliveries were made, but manufacture
reached a point where production in quantity could begin.</p>

<p>A representative of the Ordnance Department was sent to France
and England in December, 1917, to gather all the information possible
on antiaircraft artillery. As a result of his investigations it was determined
that it would be best to procure the greater part of our fire-control
equipment in France, since the instruments developed there
were in some cases of a highly complicated nature and their manufacture
entirely controlled by private parties. Orders were placed for
enough of these instruments for the equipment of the first 125 batteries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fire-control instruments of various types were in the
process of development in this country; but, as they were largely
based upon theoretical construction derived from study of the
French practices, it was deemed best not to manufacture any of these
instruments in quantity, as better instruments of French design were
available. Drawings of the French instruments were brought back
by the Ordnance officer on his visit to France and were available in
this country in the spring of 1918, when manufacture of some of them
began in the United States.</p>

<p>At the signing of the armistice our forces in France were equipped
almost wholly with antiaircraft artillery loaned to us and supplied
by the French. This, of course, does not include the 101 improvised
and truck mounts completed during 1917. Production here, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ever,
had reached such a point that shipment of material would have
begun in quantity in January, 1919.</p>

<p>The estimated requirements of antiaircraft artillery for 2,000,000
men in 48 divisions is only 120 guns. Other material, of course,
would have been required previously for defense of depots, railheads,
etc., dependent in a great measure upon the activities of German
bombers. It is estimated that about 200 guns would have sufficed
for this purpose.</p>

<p>To summarize, 50 of the so-called improvised 75-millimeter antiaircraft
guns and mounts had been ordered and completed up to the
time of the signing of the armistice; 51 of the 75-millimeter antiaircraft
mounts, model of 1917, had been ordered and 46 completed;
while 612 of the 3-inch antiaircraft trailer carriage mounts, model of
1917, had been ordered, of which 1 had been actually delivered at the
signing of the armistice, the balance to come at the rate of 26 per
month starting in December.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

RAILWAY ARTILLERY.</h3>


<p>As soon as war was declared against Germany the Ordnance
Department, in its search for an immediate equipment of strong
artillery, surveyed the ordnance supplies of the country and discovered
some 464 heavy guns which might be spared from the
seacoast defenses, obtained from the Navy, or commandeered
at private ordnance plants where they were being manufactured
for foreign Governments. There were six guns of this last-named
class&mdash;powerful 12-inch weapons which had been produced for the
Chilean Government. It was seen that if all, or if a large part,
of these guns could be made available for service in France, America
would quickly provide for herself a heavy artillery equipment of
respectable proportions.</p>

<p>The guns thus available for mounting on railway cars ranged in
size from the 7-inch guns of the Navy to the single enormous 16-inch
howitzer which had been built experimentally by the Ordnance
Department prior to 1917. The list of these guns according to
number, size, length, and source whence obtained was as follows:</p>

<p>In addition to these there was the 16-inch howitzer, 20 calibers
in length, which had been built by the Ordnance Department before
1917.</p>

<p>The expression 14-inch gun, 50 calibers, means that the gun has
a barrel diameter of 14 inches and that the gun body is fifty times
the caliber of 14 inches, or 700 inches (58 feet 4 inches) long.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department conceived that the only way to
make these guns available for use abroad would be to mount them
on railway cars. These guns were not vital in the defense of our
coast under the conditions of the war with Germany, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
evident that they would make a valuable type of long-range artillery
when placed on satisfactory railway mounts.</p>

<p>Mounting heavy artillery on railway cars, however, was not an
idea born of the recent war. The idea was probably originally
American. The Union forces at the siege of Richmond in 1863
mounted a 13-inch cast-iron mortar on a reinforced flat car, this
being the first authenticated record of the use of heavy railway
artillery.</p>

<p>In 1913 the commanding officer of the defenses of the Potomac,
which comprise Forts Washington and Hunt, was called upon to
report on the condition of these defenses. In reply, he advised
that no further expenditure be made on any one of the fixed
defenses, but recommended that a "strategic railroad" be built
along the backbone of the peninsula from Point Lookout to Washington,
with spurs leading to predetermined positions both on
Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, so placed as to command
approaches to Washington and Baltimore.</p>

<p>Further, he recommended that 4 major-caliber guns, 16 medium-caliber
guns, and 24 mine-defense guns be mounted on railroad platforms,
with ammunition, range finding, and repair cars making up
complete units, so that this armament could be quickly transported
at any time to the place where most needed. He suggested that this
scheme be made applicable to any portion of the coast line of the
United States. His argument was based upon the fact that guns in
fixed positions, of whatever caliber, violate the cardinal military
principle of mobility.</p>

<p>The nations engaged in the war now ending developed to a high
stage the use of heavy artillery mounted on railway cars, bringing
about a combination of the necessary rigidity with great mobility,
considering the weight of this material.</p>

<p>Railway artillery came to be as varied in its design as field artillery.
Each type of railway mount had certain tactical uses and it was not
considered desirable to use the different types interchangeably. The
three types of cannon used on railway mounts were mortars, howitzers,
and guns. It was not practicable to use the same type of
railway mounts for the different kinds of cannon. Moreover, these
mounts differed radically from the mounts for such weapons at the
seacoast defenses.</p>

<p>The three general types of railway mounts adopted were those
which gave the gun all-around fire (360-degree traverse), those which
provided limited traverse for the gun, and those which allowed no
lateral movement for the gun on the carriage but were used on curved
track, or epis, to give the weapons traverse aim.</p>

<p>The smaller weapons, such as the 7-inch and the 8-inch guns and
the 12-inch mortars, were placed on mounts affording 360-degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
traverse. The limited traverse mounts were used for the moderately
long-range guns and howitzers. The fixed type of mount was used
for long-range guns only, and included the sliding railway mounts,
such as the American 12-inch and 14-inch sliding mounts and the
French Schneider &agrave; glissement mounts.</p>

<p>The work of providing railway artillery&mdash;that is, taking the big,
fixed-position guns already in existence within the United States and
similar guns being produced and designing and manufacturing suitable
mounts for them on railway cars&mdash;grew into such an important
undertaking that it enlisted the exclusive attention of a large section
within the Ordnance Department. This organization eventually
found itself engaged in 10 major construction projects, which, in
time, had the war continued, would have delivered more than 300
of these monster weapons to the field in France and, to a lesser
extent, to the railway coast defenses of the United States.</p>

<p>As it was, so much of the construction&mdash;the machining of parts,
and so on&mdash;was complete at the date of the armistice, that it was
decided to go ahead with all of the projects except three, these
involving the mounting of 16 guns of 14-inch size, 50 calibers long,
the production of 25 long-range 8-inch guns, 50 calibers, and their
mounting on railway cars, and the mounting of 18 coast-defense,
10-inch guns, 34 calibers long, on the French Batignolles type of
railway mount.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it will be necessary in this chapter to refer frequently
to the barbette, Schneider, and Batignolles types of gun mounts for
railway artillery, it should be made clear to the reader what these
types are.</p>

<p>The barbette carriage revolves about a central pintle, or axis, and
turns the gun around with it. When it was decided to put coast-defense
guns on railway cars, the guns were taken from their emplacements,
barbette carriages manufactured for them, and the whole
mounted upon special cars. The barbette mount revolves on a support
of rollers traveling upon a circular base ring. In the railway
mount the base ring is attached to the dropped central portion of the
railway car. The barbette railway mount is provided with struts
and plates by which the car is braced against the ground.</p>

<p>The Schneider railway mount is named after the French ordnance
concern Schneider et Cie, who designed it. In this mount the
gun and its carriage are fastened rigidly parallel to the long axis of
the railway car. Thus the gun itself, independently of any movement
of the car, can be pointed only up and down in a vertical plane,
having no traverse or swing from left to right, and vice versa. In
order to give the weapon traverse for its aim, special railway curved
tracks, called epis, are prepared at the position where it is to be
fired. The car is then run along the curve until its traverse aim is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
correct, and the vertical aim is achieved by the movement of the
gun itself. In the Schneider mount there is no recoil mechanism,
but the recoil is absorbed by the retrograde movement of the car
itself along the rails after the gun is fired. This movement, of course,
puts the gun out of aim, and the entire unit must then be pushed
by hand power back to the proper point.</p>

<p>In the Batignolles type, gun and cradle are mounted on a so-called
top carriage that permits of small changes in horizontal pointing
right and left. Thus with the railway artillery of the Batignolles
type also, track curves, or epis, are necessary for the accurate aiming.
The Batignolles mount partially cushions the recoil by the
movement of the gun itself in the cradle. But, in addition, a special
track is provided at the firing point and the entire gun car is run
on this track and bolted to it with spades driven into the ground
to resist what recoil is not taken up in the cradle. The unit is thus
stationary in action, and the gun can be more readily returned to
aim than can a gun on a Schneider mount.</p>


<h4>THE 7-INCH RIFLES.</h4>

<p>The conditions under which the war with Germany was fought
virtually precluded any chance of a naval attack on our shores
which would engage our fixed coast defenses. The British grand
fleet, with the assistance of fleets of the other allies and America,
had the German battle fleet securely bottled. On the other hand
there was the prowling submarine able at all times to go to sea and
even to cross the ocean, and some of the latest of these submarines
were armed with long-range medium-caliber guns. It was not
beyond possibility that some sort of an attack would be made on
our shores by submarines of this character, yet it was safe to believe
that these craft would keep well out of range of the guns at our
stationary coast defenses.</p>

<p>To protect our coast from such attack the Ordnance Department
conceived the plan of mounting heavy guns on railway cars. They
might then be moved quickly to places on the seacoast needing defense.
For this purpose the Navy turned 12 of its 7-inch rifles over
to the Ordnance Department for mounting. Meanwhile our ordnance
officers had designed certain standard railway artillery cars,
known as models 1918, 1918 Mark I, and 1918 Mark II, for 7-inch
and 8-inch guns and 12-inch mortars, respectively. These cars all
had the same general features.</p>

<p>The model 1918 car was selected for the converted 7-inch Navy
rifle. The rifle was mounted on a pedestal set on the gun car in
such a manner as to give all-around fire, or 360-degree traverse.
The pedestal mount permitted the gun to be depressed at an angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
suitable for firing from high places along the coast down upon the
low-lying submarines.</p>

<p>Contracts for the various parts for these cars and the pedestal
gun mounts were let to concerns engaged in heavy steel manufacture,
but the assembling was done by the American Car &amp; Foundry Co.,
of Berwick, Pa. Twelve of the 7-inch rifles were so mounted. As
this equipment was intended exclusively for use in this country, the
gun cars were equipped with the American type of car couplings.</p>


<h4>THE 8-INCH GUNS.</h4>

<p>For the 8-inch guns taken from seacoast fortifications the Ordnance
Department designed a barbette mount giving complete, 360-degree,
traverse, thus providing for fire in any direction. There were
96 such guns available for railway mounts. Orders for 47 gun cars
with carriages for mounting the weapons were placed with three
concerns&mdash;the Morgan Engineering Co., of Alliance, Ohio, the Harrisburg
Manufacturing &amp; Boiler Co., of Harrisburg, Pa., and the American
Car &amp; Foundry Co., of Berwick. Two of the three contractors
found it necessary to provide additional facilities and machine-tool
equipment at their plants in order to handle this job.</p>

<p>The first railway mount for the 8-inch gun was completed and
sent to the Aberdeen Proving Ground for test in May, 1918. In
early June the test had shown that the weapon was efficient and
entirely satisfactory. Before the end of the year 1918 a total of
24 complete units, with ammunition cars for standard-gauge track,
shell cars for narrow-gauge track, transportation cars, tools, spare
parts, and all the other necessary appurtenances of a unit of this
character, had been completed. Three complete 8-inch units were
shipped overseas before the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>When the armistice came the Harrisburg company had delivered
9 of these mounts and the Morgan Engineering Co. an equal number,
making 18 in all. The former concern had reached an output of
5 mounts per month and the latter 10 per month.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of this mount is that it can be used either
on standard-gauge or on narrow-gauge railroad track. The narrow
gauge adopted was that in standard use in the fighting zones in
France, the distance between the rails being 60 centimeters, or the
approximate equivalent of 24 inches. Each gun car was provided
with interchangeable trucks to fit either gauge. The artillery train
necessary for the maneuvering of the weapon was also similarly
equipped to travel on either sort of track.</p>

<p>As a rule the longer the barrel of a cannon, the greater its range.
The 8-inch seacoast guns thus mounted were 35 calibers in length, that
is, thirty-five times 8 inches, or 23 feet 4 inches. The requirements
of our forces in the field in France called for guns of this same size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
but of longer range. Consequently an 8-inch gun of 50 calibers&mdash;that
is, 10 feet longer than the seacoast 8-inch gun&mdash;was designed,
and 25 of them were ordered. This project came as a later development
in the war, the guns being intended for use abroad in 1920.
The railway mounts for the weapons had not been placed in production
when the armistice came. Because of the incomplete status
of this project in the autumn of 1918, the whole undertaking was
abandoned.</p>


<h4>10-INCH AND 12-INCH GUNS.</h4>

<p>There were at the seacoast defenses and in the stores of the Army
a large number of 10-inch guns of 34 calibers. Of these 129 were
available for mounting on railway cars. It was proposed to mount
these weapons on two types of French railway mounts&mdash;the Schneider
and the Batignolles.</p>

<p>The project to mount 36 of these weapons on Schneider mounts
was taken up as a joint operation of the United States and French
Governments, the heavy forging and rough machining to be done
in this country and the finishing and assembling in the French shops.
The American contractors were three. The Harrisburg Manufacturing
&amp; Boiler Co. undertook to furnish the major portion of the
fabricated materials for the carriages and cars. The Pullman Car
Co. contracted to produce the necessary trucks for the gun cars,
while the American Car &amp; Foundry Co. engaged to build the ammunition
cars.</p>

<p>Eight sets of fabricated parts to be assembled in France had been
produced before the armistice was signed. Gen. Pershing had
requested the delivery in France of the 36 sets of parts by March
2, 1919. After the armistice was signed there was a natural letdown
in speed in nearly all ordnance factories, but even without the
spur of military necessity the contracting concerns were able by
April 7, 1919, to deliver 22 of the 36 sets ordered. Had the war
continued through the winter there is little question but that all 36
sets of parts would have been in France on the date specified.</p>

<p>The 10-inch seacoast gun, Batignolles mount project, was placed
exclusively in the hands of the Marion Steam Shovel Co., of Marion,
Ohio. It had been proposed also to mount 12-inch seacoast guns
on this same type of equipment, and this work, too, went to the
Marion concern. There were to be produced 18 of the 10-inch
units and 12 of the larger ones.</p>

<p>The Marion Steam Shovel Co. had had a large experience in producing
heavy construction and road-building equipment. The
concern encountered numerous difficulties at the start in translating
the French drawings and in substituting the American standard
materials for those specified by the French. These difficulties,
combined with struggles to obtain raw materials and the equipment
for the increased facilities which had to be provided at the factory,
so delayed production that no mount for either the 10-inch or 12-inch
guns had been delivered at the time of the armistice. The
first mount of these classes&mdash;one with a 12-inch gun&mdash;reached the
Aberdeen proving ground about April 1, 1919. The 10-inch project,
calling for 18 mounts, was canceled soon after November 11,
1918. The work on the dozen mounts for 12-inch guns, however,
had progressed so far that the Ordnance Department ordered the
completion of the entire equipment.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the Government found in this country six
12-inch guns being made for the Republic of Chile. Their length
of 50 calibers gave them a specially long range. It was decided to
place the Chilean guns on a sliding mount. In a mount of this type
the retrograde movement of the car along the track as and after
the gun is fired takes up and absorbs the energy of fire.</p>

<p>The first sliding railway mount used on the allied side in the great
war was of French design. But our manufacturers had so much
trouble with French designs that when the project came up of mounting
the Chilean guns in this fashion it was decided that it would be
quicker to design our own mount. Consequently the French design
was taken in hand by our ordnance engineers and redesigned to conform
to American practice, with the inclusion in the design of all
original ideas developed by the Ordnance Department in its creative
work during the war period up to that time. The manufacturers
who looked at the French design of the sliding railway mount estimated
that it would take from 12 to 18 months before the unit could
be duplicated in this country and first deliveries made. They looked
at the American design and estimated that they could build it in 3
months.</p>

<p>It was decided to build three mounts of this character and thus
have a reserve of one gun for each mount to serve as replacement
when the original guns were worn out. Contracts were placed
in the early summer of 1918, and all three mounts were delivered
before the armistice was signed, the first mount being completed
within 85 days after the order was placed. For these mounts the
American Bridge Co. furnished the main girders or side pieces, the
Baldwin Locomotive Co. built the railway trucks, and the Morgan
Engineering Co. manufactured the many other parts and assembled
the complete units. The speed in manufacture was made possible
by the fact that the plant engineers of the three companies helped
the ordnance officers in designing the details. With such intimate
cooperation, the concerns were able to begin the manufacture of component
parts while the drawings were being made.</p>

<p>All three weapons with their entire equipment, including supplies,
spare parts, ammunition cars, and the whole trains that make up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
such units, were ready for shipment to France in November, 1918.
Each mount as it stands to-day is 105 feet long and weighs 600,000
pounds. The load of the gun and the peak load put on the carriage
when the gun is fired are so great that it requires four trucks of 8
wheels each, 32 car wheels in all, to distribute the load safely over
ordinary standard-gauge track.</p>


<h4>THE 12-INCH MORTARS.</h4>

<p>In years past the Ordnance Department had procured a large number
of 12-inch mortars for use at seacoast defenses. These great
weapons are 10 calibers in length, or 10 feet in linear measurement,
the diameter of the barrel being just an even foot. Of the
number stationed at the coastal forts and in reserve it was decided
that 150 could be safely withdrawn and prepared for use against
Germany. When Gen. Pershing was informed of the proposal, he
asked that 40 of these weapons mounted on railway cars should be
delivered to the American Expeditionary Forces for use in the planned
campaign of 1919. In order that there might be an adequate supply
of them, the Ordnance Department let contracts for the mounting
of 91 of these mortars on railway equipment, a project which would
give the United States a formidable armament and still provide a
reserve of 59 mortars to replace the service mortars on the carriages
after repeated firing had worn them out.</p>

<p>This job proved to be one of the largest in the whole artillery program.
The entire contract was let to the Morgan Engineering Co.,
of Alliance, Ohio. In order to handle the contract, a special ordnance
plant, costing $1,700,000 for the building alone, had to be constructed
at the company's works at Alliance. The work was so highly specialized
that machine tools designed for the particular purpose had to
be produced. The Government itself bought these tools at a cost of
$1,800,000. Although work on this plant was not started until December
10, 1917, and although thereafter followed weeks and weeks
of the severest winter weather known in recent years, with all the
delays in the deliveries of materials which such weather conditions
bring about, the plant was entirely complete on June 1, 1918, not
only, but the work of producing the mounts had started in it long
before that, some machines getting to work as early as April.</p>

<p>The gun car used for mounting the mortar carriage was of the same
design as that for the 7-inch and 8-inch guns, except that each truck
had six wheels. The carriage built upon this car was of the barbette
type, and it allowed the gun to be pointed upward to an angle as
high as 65&deg; and provided complete traverse, so that the mortar could
be fired in any direction from the car. A hydropneumatic system
for absorbing the recoil of the mortar after firing was adopted. This
recuperator in itself was a difficult problem for the manufacturer to
solve, being the first hydropneumatic recuperator of the size ever
built in this country.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the weight and elaborate character of this unit it was
put into production in an astonishingly short space of time. The
pilot mount came through on August 22, 1918, less than nine months
after the spade was first struck in the ground to begin the erection
of the ordnance plant. By the end of August the pilot mortar had
successfully passed its firing tests at Aberdeen, functioning properly
at angles of elevation from 22 degrees to 65 degrees and in any direction
from the mount. While this unit was put through hurriedly for
these tests, the preparation for the rest of the deliveries was made on
a grand scale, looking toward quantity production later on. When
the armistice was signed, every casting, forging, and structural part
for every one of the 91 railway mounts was on hand and completed
at the works of the Morgan Engineering Co., and thereafter the
process was merely one of assembling, although in a unit of such size
the assembling job alone was one of great magnitude. Even at the
reduced rate of production incident to the relaxation of tension
after the armistice was signed, the company delivered 45 complete
units to the Government up to April 7, 1919, or five more than Gen.
Pershing said he would require during the whole campaign of 1919.
Careful estimates show that if the war had continued the company
would have delivered the mounts at the rate of 15 per month beginning
on December 15, 1918, a rate which would have completed the
entire project for 91 mounts by the middle of June, 1919.</p>

<p>As in the case of the 8-inch railway guns, the 12-inch mortars were
provided with interchangeable wheel trucks allowing the unit to
travel and work either on standard-gauge track or on the 60-centimeter,
narrow-gauge track of the war zone in France.</p>


<h4>14-INCH GUNS.</h4>

<p>The War Department did not have any 14-inch guns which could
be spared from the seacoast defenses for use abroad. The Ordnance
Department, therefore, inaugurated the project for the construction
of 60 guns of 14-inch caliber. For the construction of such guns
complete new plants were required, as all available facilities were
already taken over for other projects considered more important.
This contract was to have been turned out by the Neville Island
ordnance plant. The Navy Department in May, 1918, expressed
willingness to turn over to the Army certain 14-inch guns, 50 calibers,
then under construction and of which it was estimated that 30 would
be completed by March, 1919.</p>

<p>It was decided to place some of these 14-inch guns on American
sliding railway mounts, and 16 such mounts were ordered from the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, deliveries to begin February 1, 1919.
The 16 units were to be delivered prior to April, 1919, but due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
signing of the armistice work was suspended on the contracts, since
the mounts were designed for use in France. The contract was
canceled in March, 1919.</p>

<p>The Navy itself placed five of these guns on railway mounts of
another design to be operated in France by naval forces on shore.
Eleven such mounts were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works
under the supervision of the Navy Ordnance Bureau, and six of
them were afterwards turned over to the Army.</p>


<h4>THE 16-INCH HOWITZER.</h4>

<p>Without discussing here the 12-inch howitzers, 20 feet long, which
the Ordnance Department ordered produced and mounted on
railway trucks, a development for use abroad in 1920, we come,
finally, to the largest weapon of all in the railway artillery program,
the 16-inch howitzer, the barrel of this mighty weapon being 26
feet 6 inches long. The American 16-inch howitzer had been forged
out and finished prior to the date of America's entrance into the war.
It was proposed to place this weapon on a railway mount and make
it available for use on the western front.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department completed the design for the mount
on February 10, 1918. In order to turn out the unit in the shortest
possible time, the project was placed with three manufacturers,
each of whom was to produce different parts. The American Bridge
Co. received the order to build the structural parts, the Baldwin
Locomotive Works contracted for the trucks, while the Morgan
Engineering Co. undertook to assemble the unit and also to build
the top carriage and other mechanical parts. The contractors did
a speedy job in producing the mount for this howitzer.</p>

<p>In nearly all railway artillery of this size it is necessary to provide
bracing when the gun is set up in position for firing. The 16-inch
howitzer mount was unique in that the weapon could be fired from
the trucks without any track preparation whatsoever. An exhaustive
test at the Aberdeen proving grounds demonstrated that this
piece of artillery ranked with the highest types of ordnance in use
by any country in the world.</p>

<p>In the meantime orders had been placed for 61 additional howitzers.
The American Expeditionary Forces asked that 12 of these enormous
weapons be sent overseas as soon as they could be produced, a job
which would have extended over a period of months, if not
years. Since none of the additional howitzers had been produced
when the armistice was signed, the project of building mounts for
them never got under way. The pilot howitzer and mount were not
shipped abroad.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In the design of railway equipment for high-angle weapons such
as howitzers, two loads must be considered by the builders in order
to provide a gun car of sufficient strength to hold its freight. One
of these loads, the lighter one, consists merely of the ordinary weight
of the gun and its carriage upon the car wheels. The other load, the
so-called firing load, consists of the weight of the unit plus the additional
weight of the down-thrust of the howitzer when it recoils. In
the case of the 16-inch howitzer the firing load is 748,231 pounds.
The weight of 748,231 pounds must be distributed along the tracks
by the numerous sets of wheels at the instant the gun is fired.</p>

<p>The mount for the howitzer is so constructed that this load is
partly taken up by the slide of the gun car along the track. In
addition, the howitzer is equipped with a hydraulic recoil cylinder.
Thus the unit has a double recoil system. The car trucks in the tests
comfortably transmitted, through a series of equalizer springs,
this enormous load upon an ordinary rock-ballast track, without
any distortion to the track or roadbed or impairment to the working
parts of the unit. After each discharge the whole huge mount moves
backward along the track for a distance of 20 or 30 feet.</p>

<p>Each railway artillery project called for the manufacture of a great
equipment of ammunition cars, fire-control cars, spare-parts cars,
supply cars, and the like, a complete unit being a heavy train in itself.
Such armament-train cars, together with numerous other accessories
and necessary equipment, were designed by the Ordnance Department
and produced for each mount. In all, 530 ammunition cars
were produced up to April, 1919. Most of them were shipped abroad,
but 118 were retained for use in this country. Since the overseas
cars were to be used with French railway equipment, it was necessary
to fit them out with French standard screw couplers, air brakes, and
other appliances for connecting up with French railway cars.</p>

<p>The matter of traction power for these gun and armament trains
near the front set a problem for the Ordnance Department to solve.
It was out of the question to use steam engines near the enemy's lines,
since the steam and smoke would betray the location of artillery
trains at great distances. The Ordnance Department adopted a
gas-electric locomotive of 400 horsepower to be used to pull railway
artillery trains at the front, and was on the point of letting a contract
to the General Electric Co. for the manufacture of 50 of them when
the armistice was signed.</p>


<h4>NEVILLE ISLAND.</h4>

<p>It seems fitting at this point to say something about the Neville
Island ordnance plant, on an island in the Ohio River near Pittsburgh,
which would have produced weapons of the character of those used
with railway mounts and would have turned them out in large
numbers had the armistice not come to put an end to this enormous
project. The plant was being erected for the Government by
the United States Steel Corporation without profit to itself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
estimated cost of this plant when finished was $150,000,000. Designed
to supply the needs of the Army for artillery of the heaviest types,
the Neville Island plant was being constructed on such a scale that
it would surpass in size and capacity any of the famous gun works of
Europe, including the Krupps.</p>

<p>It was being equipped to handle huge ordnance undertakings,
such as the monthly completion of 15 great 14-inch guns and the
production of 40,000 projectiles monthly for 14-inch and 16-inch
guns. The plans of the Government contemplated the production
of 14-inch guns to the number of 165 in all and their shipment to
France in time to be in the field before May 1, 1920. An initial order
for 90 of these weapons had been placed at the arsenal while it was
being erected.</p>

<p>Besides 14-inch guns the plant was being equipped to turn out
16-inch and even 18-inch weapons. The immense size of the machinery
necessary for such production can be understood when it is noted
that an 18-inch gun weighs 510,000 pounds and a 14-inch gun 180,000
pounds. It requires from 12 to 18 months to produce guns of this
size, yet Neville Island was being developed on a scale to build hundreds
of them simultaneously. The entire plant was to cover 573
acres and was to employ 20,000 workmen when in full operation.</p>

<p>At the signing of the armistice work was suspended at Neville
Island, and four months later the whole project was abandoned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

EXPLOSIVES, PROPELLANTS, AND ARTILLERY AMMUNITION.</h3>


<p>The Interallied Ordnance Agreement of the late fall of 1917,
supplying to the United States as it did French and British artillery
and other heavy ordnance supplies until the developing American
ordnance industry could come into production, nevertheless called
upon the United States to produce heavily the explosives and propellants
that are of such major importance to a modern army.
These commodities were needed by the armies of France and Great
Britain more than any other sort of ordnance which America could
supply.</p>

<p>The result was an enormous production of propellants and explosives
in the United States during the period of American belligerency,
no other prime phase of the ordnance program being carried to such
a stage of development. The reader will clearly see the distinction
between propellants and explosives. The propellant is the smokeless
powder that sends the shell or bullet from the gun; the explosive is
the bursting charge within the shell.</p>

<p>To realize the expansion of the American explosives industry
during the war period, consider such figures as these: America in 19
months turned out 632,504,000 pounds of propellants&mdash;the powder
loaded into small-arms cartridges or packed into the big guns behind
the projectiles to send them against the enemy. In those same 19
months France produced 342,155,000 pounds of propellants and
Great Britain 291,706,000 pounds. The American production was
practically equal to that of England and France together.</p>

<p>In those 19 months we produced 375,656,000 pounds of high
explosives for loading into shell. In the same 19 months England
produced 765,110,000 pounds of high explosives and France 702,964,000
pounds. America was below both France and England in
total output, but in monthly rate of output America had reached
47,888,000 pounds as against France's 22,802,000 pounds and England's
30,957,000 pounds. Our rate of manufacturing propellants
at the end of the fighting was up to 42,775,000 pounds as against
France's 17,311,000 and England's 12,055,000.</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows graphically the achievements of America in manufacturing
propellants and explosives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>In the production of artillery ammunition a comparison with
France and Great Britain shows that our monthly rate in turning
out unfilled rounds of ammunition at the end of the war was 7,044,000
rounds, as against 7,748,000 rounds for Great Britain and 6,661,000
rounds for France. In producing complete rounds of artillery
ammunition, our monthly rate at the signing of the armistice was
2,429,000 rounds while that of Great Britain was 7,347,000 rounds
and that of France 7,638,000 rounds.</p>

<p>In the 19 months of our participation in the war our production of
unfilled rounds in ammunition was 38,623,000 rounds, while that of
France was 156,170,000 rounds and that of Great Britain 138,357,000
rounds. In that time we had produced 17,260,000 complete rounds,
while France had produced 149,827,000 rounds, and Great Britain
121,739,000 complete rounds.</p>

<p>The entrance of the United States into the war found the existing
American explosives manufacturers operating to the very limit of
their capacity in production for the allied governments and for
general commercial purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in 1914 the explosives business in
this country had increased enormously and the trained men familiar
with manufacturing operations and conditions in this highly specialized
and extremely dangerous industry had fallen short of meeting
demands.</p>

<p>When we entered the war, therefore, it became necessary at once to
distribute this limited force of experts as equitably as possible and to
put chemists, engineers and other specialists in the various plants
under the supervision of this trained personnel so as to produce in
as quick a time as possible a vastly enlarged force of competent
operators and supervisors for the production of explosives.</p>

<p>Summed up, the problem that faced the Ordnance Department
was, while maintaining the current great production of explosives,
to expand enormously the facilities for further production, to provide
personnel for operating these expanded facilities, to build up
entirely new manufacturing plants for making both propellants and
high explosives, and in addition to all of this, to bring into existence
huge loading plants.</p>

<p>In all, 53 new plants for making explosives and propellants and for
loading these were undertaken at a cost of approximately $360,000,000.
When the armistice was signed a very large part of this construction
work had been completed and was in an efficient state of
operation.</p>

<p>How creditably this reflects upon America can be understood when
it is made plain that in addition to the development of production
there was also to be worked out the very intricate question of design,
not only of the plants themselves but also of their products, which
required an exceptional degree of technical skill and thorough control.</p>

<p>Prior to our entry into the war the Ordnance Department had
depended upon ammonium picrate, known in the Army vernacular as
explosive "D," as a bursting charge for our high-explosive shell.</p>

<p>During the progress of the European conflict the British had developed
an explosive they called amatol, which is a mixture of trinitrotoluol&mdash;T. N. T.&mdash;and
ammonium nitrate. As this had proved to be
entirely satisfactory in actual service on European battle fields, and
as ammonium nitrate could be produced here in large quantities, we
adopted it.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department eventually put into effect a standard
policy for the use of high explosives. Every effort was being made
to conserve the supply of T. N. T., and consequently this explosive
was specified for the shell of smaller calibers only. The standard
filling scheme was as follows: T. N. T. for shell between and including
the calibers of 75-millimeter and 4.7-inch; amatol for shell of calibers
between 4.7-inch and 9.2-inch, including the latter; ammonium
picrate, or explosive D, for shell of 10-inch caliber and higher. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
these were the standards the scheme was not always followed rigidly.
As a matter of fact amatol was loaded into shell of all sizes and so
was T. N. T., although explosive D was never used in shell smaller
than those for the 10-inch guns. These departures from standard
practice were due to the necessity for keeping certain plants in production
and to other special causes and exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Production of large quantities of T. N. T. and ammonium nitrate
was the first big problem to be solved by the high-explosives section
of the Ordnance Department. All the work of the explosives section
can be subdivided under four group heads&mdash;raw materials, propellants,
high explosives, and loading.</p>


<h4>RAW MATERIALS.</h4>

<p>The first steps taken in the endeavor to meet the need for raw
materials were to increase greatly the available means for obtaining
toluol, phenol, caustic soda, sodium nitrate, sulphuric and nitric
acids, ammonia liquor or aqua ammonia, and to attempt to provide
a substitute for cellulose in case a shortage of cotton should render
its use necessary.</p>

<p>How to increase the supply of toluol, the basic raw material from
which T. N. T. is made, was the greatest and most pressing of all
the problems in regard to the existing raw materials. Before the
war the sole source of this ingredient was from by-product coke ovens.
The monthly capacity of these ovens in 1914 was, approximately,
700,000 pounds. By April, 1917, when we stepped into the conflict,
this capacity had been increased to 6,000,000 pounds a month.</p>

<p>By the time the armistice was signed our efforts for greater production
had been carried on so successfully that the supply had been
increased to 12,000,000 pounds a month, and the average cost of this
was only 21 cents a pound. This tremendous increase of production
not only took care of all demands for commercial purposes and permitted
the shipment of about 11,000,000 pounds to the allied Governments,
but was more than ample to take care of our own entire
explosives program, leaving a stock on hand December 1, 1918, of
17,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>A few details of how this tremendous increase in production was
brought about through the energies of the officials charged with
this task and the most efficient and whole-hearted cooperation of
patriotic business concerns are interesting.</p>

<p>Three general sources existed from which toluol was obtained:
first, from the by-product recovery coke ovens; second, by the stripping
or absorbing of toluol from carbureted water and coal gas; and
third, by the cracking or breaking down of oils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>In augmenting the supply of toluol through the first process, construction
of additional by-product coke ovens by the following big
steel companies was arranged:</p>

<p>The total cost of these additional ovens was about $30,000,000,
which was met by private capital after contracts for the purchase
of the product had been made, insuring a secure return on the investment.
Production was to begin in 1919.</p>

<p>In addition to this there was arranged construction for 320 additional
ovens at the following places:</p>

<p>From these sources the monthly production of toluol in 1920
would have been increased by 600,000 pounds a month.</p>

<p>While all these arrangements for vastly increasing the supply of
this chemical in 1919 and 1920 were being made, technical experts
of the Ordnance Department stimulated production by visiting
existing by-product coke ovens and advising as to changes and
alterations in the plants, both in regard to equipment and methods
of operation.</p>

<p>Investigations were made early in the summer of 1917 on the possibility
of recovering toluol by stripping illuminating gas, and a report
was made on this subject in October, 1917. Construction of the
necessary plants to carry out this plan was begun late in November,
and the first plants were in operation in April, 1918. This was considered
a remarkable record, in view of the fact that the operating
personnel for the purpose had to be established and trained in this
entirely new line of activity.</p>

<p>In this connection it is extremely interesting to note that the
American people in 13 of the largest cities of the country played an
unconscious part in contributing to the successful termination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the war by using artificial gas of considerably less heating power, as a
result of the removal of the toluol for explosive purposes. For
example, in New York City, due to the extraction of toluol, the
artificial gas there was reduced in heating value approximately 6
per cent and the candlepower lowered from 22 to 16 because of this
stripping process.</p>

<p>Contracts for taking the toluol from artificial gas were made with
companies in the following cities: New York and Brooklyn, N. Y.;
Boston, Mass.; New Haven, Conn.; Albany, N. Y.; Utica, N. Y.;
Elizabeth, N. J.; Washington, D. C.; Detroit, Mich.; St. Louis, Mo.;
New Orleans, La.; Denver, Colo.; and Seattle, Wash.</p>

<p>The total cost of the installations made for this purpose in these
cities in connection with the gas plants was about $7,500,000.</p>

<p>For the production of toluol by cracking crude oils or petroleum
distillates, three processes of the many submitted were officially
approved and contracts awarded for operation.</p>

<p>The first and most important of these was that of the General
Petroleum Co. of Los Angeles, Calif. Under their scheme a yield of
6 per cent toluol was obtained from a petroleum distillate, of which
there was a large quantity available, by treatment under temperature
and pressure. To facilitate production of toluol by this means,
two large plants, one at Los Angeles and the other at San Francisco,
were erected at a cost of approximately $5,000,000. These plants
have a monthly capacity of 3,000,000 pounds of toluol and their
construction destroyed all possibility of a shortage in this vital raw
material.</p>

<p>Another process was that known as the Rittman process, evolved
by a scientist of the Bureau of Mines. This scheme, which called
for producing toluol from solvent naphtha or light oils by cracking
under high pressure and temperature, was finally demonstrated to be
capable of operation under war conditions, and production had just
started at a plant on Neville Island, Pittsburgh, Pa., at the time
of the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>A third process was that known as the Hall process, by which
toluol was also obtained by cracking solvent naphtha under high
pressure and temperature by another, different, mechanical system.
This scheme was in operation on a small scale during 1918 at the
Standard Oil Plant, Bayonne, N. J.</p>

<p>Phenol, one of the essentials in the manufacture of picric acid,
was another raw material, the production of which was greatly
augmented. At the time of our entry into the war the monthly
production amounted to 670,000 pounds, while in October, 1918, it
had been increased to 13,000,000 pounds. In December, 1917, the
price of phenol as fixed by the War Industries Board was 46 cents
a pound, while Government contracts in force a year later had reduced
this figure to 31 cents a pound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The price of sulphuric acid jumped from $14 a ton to $60 a ton
early in the war, while nitric acid advanced from 5&frac14; cents a pound
to 10 cents. The shortage of sulphuric acid was met by the erection
of both chamber and contact plants in all high-explosives factories
built for or under direction of the Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>Both pyrites and sulphur were used at the beginning of the war,
but the submarine warfare stopped the importation of the pyrites
from Spain, and therefore sulphur deposits in Texas and Louisiana
were depended upon. A destructive storm in the early part of 1918
temporarily curtailed the production from Louisiana deposits, but
repairs were made in time to prevent its effect being felt by the
acid manufacturers.</p>

<p>The submarine also had the effect of lessening the importations
from Chile of sodium nitrate, which prior to the war were depended
upon entirely in the production of nitric acid. It became necessary,
therefore, to develop other methods of production. After investigations
a plant for the fixation of nitrogen under what is known as a
modified Haber process was erected at Sheffield, Ala., while a plant
for the same purpose using the cyanamide process was erected at
Muscle Shoals, Ala.</p>

<p>Both of these were equipped for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric
acid, each using a different process. When the armistice was signed
these plants were just coming into production. The existence of
these two nitrate plants insures the independence of this country in
its supply of commercial nitrogen, either for peace or for war.</p>

<p>There were also in course of erection, though not in operation on
November 11, 1918, great plants for the extraction of nitrogen from
the air, at Toledo and Cincinnati, Ohio, but construction on these
two plants, each of which was to cost $25,000,000, was stopped when
the armistice was signed.</p>


<h4>PROPELLANTS.</h4>

<p>In army usage the term "propellant" includes both smokeless
powder and black powder.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the European war, the producing capacity in
this country for smokeless powder was approximately 1,500,000
pounds a month. By the time the United States got into the war
this capacity had been increased from 25 to 30 times, and under the
explosives program laid down by us it was indicated that even this
capacity would have to be greatly increased.</p>

<p>The increase in the production of smokeless powder was helped
by the construction of two of the largest smokeless-powder plants in
the world&mdash;one known as the Old Hickory Plant, located almost on
the site of Andrew Jackson's old home at Nashville, Tenn., and the
other at Nitro, near Charleston, W. Va.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The Old Hickory Plant was the larger and more complete of
the two. It is probably the biggest plant of its kind in the world
and is entirely self-contained; in other words, the plant actually takes
the crude, raw cotton and, producing both the acid and solvents used,
puts it through every process until the final product is attained.</p>

<p>Nine powder lines were planned for this enterprise, each with a
capacity of 100,000 pounds per day, although developments from the
early operations indicated that the ultimate production of the plant
would reach 1,000,000 pounds a day.</p>

<p>The estimated cost of this huge undertaking was in the neighborhood
of $90,000,000. Negotiations were begun in October of 1917
and led to a contract with the du Pont Engineering Co., under which
this concern was to construct the plant and operate it for a six
months' period after its completion.</p>

<p>Operation of the first powder line in the plant was to start September
15, 1918, or seven and one-half months after the signing
of the contract. Ground was broken March 8, 1918, and work was
pushed so efficiently and successfully that on July 1, 1918, the first
powder line was put in operation, 75 days ahead of the schedule
called for in the contract.</p>

<p>Some idea of the magnitude of this enterprise can be realized in the
statements that the plant covers an area of 5,000 acres and that in
addition to the powder plant proper there was built a city, housing
twenty odd thousand people, complete with schools, churches,
and all other elements that go to make up a town. There was also
built in connection with the plant a number of subprocess plants for
the manufacture of purified cotton, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, diphenylamine,
and other chemicals used in powder manufacture. Each
of these was an undertaking of no little size in itself.</p>

<p>Operation of the plant during the four and one-half months preceding
the signing of the armistice showed a production in excess of
contract requirements. On November 11, 1918, the plant was over
90 per cent complete and about 50 per cent in operation. At that
time 6,000,000 pounds of powder over and above contract expectations
had been produced, the total capacity having reached 423,000
pounds a day.</p>

<p>The second powder plant, located at Nitro, is somewhat smaller
than the Old Hickory Plant. It has a capacity of 625,000 pounds of
smokeless powder a day. It was built under the direction of D. C.
Jackling, director of United States Government explosive plants, by
the Thompson-Starrett Co., of New York. The contract was dated
January 18, 1918, and ground was broken February 1. A contract
for the operation of the plant was signed with the Hercules Powder
Co., and at the time of the armistice the output was running approximately
109,000 pounds a day, with the expectation of early and
speedy increase. As in the case of the Old Hickory Plant, a large
village and many subprocess plants were constructed in connection
with this enterprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>When the war began smokeless powder was dried by the circulation
of warm dried air for a long period of time over the damp powder
as it came from the solvent recovery house. This process required
from six weeks for small-caliber powder to nine months for large-caliber
powder. This time-consuming method being obviously impracticable
in war, the Ordnance Department authorized the so-called
water-drying process. This consists in the immersion of the
powder as it comes from the solvent recovery house in warm water
for varying periods up to 72 hours, the water then being expelled
by filtration or centrifugal force and the surplus external moisture
dried off by hot air. By this method the time of drying was reduced
to 4 days for the small-caliber powder and to 22 days for powder for
the larger caliber guns.</p>

<p>Just prior to the signing of the armistice an entirely new drying
process had been experimentally tried out. This was known as the
Nash or alcohol-drying process. The preliminary tests indicated
that this method was a great improvement both in safety and in the
reduction of cost. The indications were that drying could be reduced
from days to hours by this new method. The Nash process also insured
apparently a more uniform and tougher grade of powder, both
of which characteristics were greatly to be desired.</p>

<p>In spite of the rise in price of labor and of almost everything else,
the cost of powder was being reduced. At the beginning of the war
cost figures were 80 cents a pound for small-arms and 53 cents a
pound for cannon powder. When the armistice was signed these
costs had been reduced to 62 cents for small-arms powder and 41&frac14;
cents for cannon powder.</p>

<p>At the time of the signing of the armistice there was on hand approximately
200,000,000 pounds of smokeless powder.</p>

<p>It early became evident that the supply of cellulose, even though
all available sources of supply were utilized to the utmost, would
nevertheless be insufficient to meet our vast production program.
For years it had been rumored that the Germans in the manufacture
of their smokeless powder had been using, with great success, cellulose
produced from wood pulp. Following out this idea, experimental
work was undertaken in an effort to develop cellulose that could be
produced from wood pulp in suitable physical form for nitration
and which would meet the chemical requirements.</p>

<p>In the southern and southwestern portions of the United States there
are large tracts of land from which timber has been removed and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
are also vast acreages of swamp lands. Processes developed by the
Ordnance Department had in view the idea of taking as much of these
lands as possible for farming and reforesting and utilizing the tree
stumps thereon. These stumps contained quantities of turpentine
and resin that could be recovered and the resultant pulp after proper
treatment could be prepared in suitable form as cellulose for nitration
purposes.</p>

<p>The question of black powder, while an important one, did not
present many difficulties excepting one, the necessary supply of
potassium nitrate. This was because Germany was the principal
source of the potash. It was thought that sodium nitrate might
possibly have to be used as a substitute. Experimental work
along these lines indicated that by using certain precautions, this
substitution, if necessary, could be made, although it was never
adopted.</p>

<p>Black powder of all grades for military purposes was being produced
at the rate of 840,000 pounds a month, at a cost of 25 cents a
pound, at the time the armistice was signed. At that time there
was on hand 6,850,000 pounds of black powder.</p>

<p>If the war had continued the United States could have produced
during the year 1919 more than 1,000,000,000 pounds of smokeless
powder. Two-thirds of this would have been available for our overseas
forces and the balance would have gone to the allied governments.
This rate of production would have amounted to about
seven times the quantity of explosives normally manufactured in
peace times.</p>


<h4>LOADING THE PROPELLANTS.</h4>

<p>In addition to solving the problem of producing a sufficient quantity
of propellant powder there was also the problem, just as important,
of assembling this powder into fixed ammunition, or loading it into
bags. The Frankford Arsenal and commercial cartridge factories,
after expansion, were enabled to take care of the expanded small-arms
program. But it became necessary for the Government to
erect and operate several great bag-loading plants. These were
located at Woodbury, N.J., Tullytown, Pa., and Seven Pines, Va.</p>

<p>The ordinary cartridge fired from the rifle is familiar to most
people. The projectile is fitted into the metal case in which the explosive
force is contained. Projectiles for big guns are made along
similar lines, until the 4.7-inch gun is reached. Up to and including
guns of this caliber the projectile is fired with what is known as fixed
ammunition&mdash;that is to say, the shell itself is fixed into a metal
container which holds the powder.</p>

<p>Guns above the caliber of 4.7 inches, however, are fired with
unfixed ammunition&mdash;that is, the powder is loaded in silk bags,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the projectile placed in the gun, and a number of bags, depending
upon the size of the charge necessary, put into the breach of the gun
behind the projectile. The powder is then ignited and the big shell
ejected by the gases generated.</p>

<p>From the mills the powder is shipped to the bag-loading plants
in bulk. The silken bags are manufactured in huge quantities by
industrial plants and forwarded to the bag-loading plants, where
are also daily received large quantities of metal and fiber containers,
into which are loaded bags packed for overseas shipment not to
be unpacked again until they have reached the battle field.</p>

<p>Filling the bags is a precise and delicate operation. Chances
can not be taken or averages struck. Errors may mean the possible
loss of battles. A battery commander who has figured his
range and who is about to drop a number of high-explosive shell
on an enemy battery must know exactly how much powder he has
behind his charge. If more powder is in the bag than he calculates
on, he will overshoot his mark; if less, the shell instead of dropping
upon an enemy battery may explode in midst of his own advancing
troops.</p>

<p>The three bag-loading plants the Government constructed at
Woodbury, Tullytown, and Seven Pines were built to load bags
that were to be used in firing guns from 155-millimeter caliber up to
a caliber of 10 inches. The estimated average capacity of each
plant was 20,000 bags a day, but as a matter of fact a maximum
capacity of 40,000 bags a day at each plant had been reached before
the signing of the armistice. Two shifts a day were used at these
plants most of the time. In each shift there were approximately
3,500 operatives, most of them women.</p>

<p>At each of these plants, which are located in comparatively
isolated points, because of the dangerous work, special housing
facilities had to be constructed. For example, at Tullytown there
were 70 bungalows, 13 residences for officers and executive heads,
and six 98-room dormitories, while at Woodbury 19 great dormitories
were built to house workers.</p>

<p>The number of buildings at Tullytown is 215. They range from
guardhouses to electrical generating stations for power and light.
Besides this construction there are between 22 and 30 miles of railroad
track laid at each of these points. The extremely dangerous nature
of the work makes it necessary to store not more than 400,000 pounds
of explosives in a single building, and where powder is stored the
buildings are at least 350 feet apart.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the signing of the armistice there were loaded
into small-arms ammunition 19,741,500 pounds of powder; there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
assembled into fixed ammunition approximately 33,000,000 pounds
of smokeless powder; and there were assembled into bags, properly
packed for shipment, approximately 32,300,000 pounds of smokeless
powder.</p>


<h4>HIGH EXPLOSIVES.</h4>

<p>When Europe was plunged into the great war in August, 1914, the
American production of trinitrotoluol for commercial purposes
amounted to approximately 600,000 pounds a month of varying
grades of purity. This quantity was almost entirely consumed in
the making of explosives for blasting purposes. When we entered
the war this production had been increased to 1,000,000 pounds a
month, exclusive of that which was being used here commercially.
Under pressure of our own war-time needs the production of this
highly important explosive chemical had been run up to 16,000,000
pounds a month at the termination of hostilities in November, 1918.</p>

<p>During the early stages of the war the average price of T. N. T. for
military purposes was $1 a pound. Largely, however, because of the
tremendous quantity production and enormous economies effected by
reason of this, and despite the scarcity of raw materials, and notwithstanding
the greatly increased labor cost, this price had been reduced
at the time of the signing of the armistice to 26&frac12; cents a pound.
There were in the course of erection at the time of the armistice,
two great Government T. N. T. plants&mdash;one at Racine, Wis., that
was to have a capacity of 4,000,000 pounds a month, and one at
Giant, Cal., with a capacity of 2,000,000 pounds a month.</p>

<p>During the war three grades of T. N. T. were produced. Grade I
was used for booster charges&mdash;that is, those charges which initiated
the explosive wave in the main shell charge. Grade II was used as
a shell filler; while Grade III was utilized with ammonium nitrate in
producing amatol.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that high explosives were produced in such
enormous quantities and that it was necessary to carry on these tremendous
manufacturing operations with an inexperienced force, the
toll of life taken in the production was remarkably small. Only two
explosions of any magnitude occurred in plants where explosives
were manufactured and both of these took place in T. N. T. producing
plants. One of these happened at Oakdale, Pa., in the plant of
the Aetna Explosives Co. in May, 1918. This cost the lives of 100
persons. The other took place on July 2, 1918, at Split Rock, N.Y.,
in the plant of Semet-Solvay Co., where 60 people lost their lives.
At the time of the explosions neither of these plants was operating
on War Department contracts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the great war about 58,000,000 pounds of ammonium
nitrate used in the manufacture of commercial explosives were being
produced annually in this country, at an average cost of about 12
cents a pound. By January, 1917, the commercial explosives manufacturers
had extended their facilities so that they had increased their
production by 1,700,000 pounds monthly. This expansion, however,
was insufficient to meet our demands, and a Government ammonium
nitrate plant was erected at Perryville, Md. This plant was operated
under the supervision of the Atlas Powder Co., who also cooperated
in its erection.</p>

<p>It did this manufacturing under the Brunner-Mond process that
was developed in England under the patents of Capt. Freeth.
Under this process ammonium nitrate is produced by the double
decomposition of ammonium sulphate and sodium nitrate.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, the Atlas people detailed several technical men
to go to England and study the Brunner-Mond process as carried on
there. In 1918 these men returned to the United States and prepared
designs as a result of the information they had gained abroad.</p>

<p>Ground was broken for the plant at Perryville March 8, 1918, and
it was in production by July 15. This plant is a large one, of excellent
construction, and absolutely fireproof, as is necessary because of
the nature of the work conducted in it. Because of the type of the
building the rapidity of its construction may well be classed as phenomenal.
Even while the plant was being put up, experimental
work of a highly technical nature was being carried on.</p>

<p>At the time of the signing of the armistice production of ammonium
nitrate at the Perryville plant had reached 452,000 pounds a day, and
this was greatly in excess of that being obtained at the English plant
of a similar size that had been in operation for months before ground
had been broken for our American plant.</p>

<p>Each of the Government-owned nitrogen fixation plants at Muscle
Shoals, Ala., and Sheffield, Ala., was also equipped to produce ammonium
nitrate by neutralization. Our total capacity from all
sources at the time of the signing of the armistice was 20,000,000
pounds monthly. Ammonium nitrate is the one material in the
field of explosives that shows an increase in price over that of normal
times. The average cost of this substance used for military
purposes was 17&frac12; cents a pound. There were on hand 60,500,000
pounds of ammonium nitrate on November 11, 1918.</p>

<p>Picric acid as such is not used by this country directly for military
purposes. But it is one of the raw materials used in producing
ammonium picrate, or explosive D, and in the manufacture of the
poisonous gas known as chlorpicrin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Picric acid is, however, the main explosive used by the French, who
had placed enormous contracts for this material with explosives
manufacturers prior to the entry of the United States in the war.
Because of our purchase of early large supplies of ammunition and
guns from the French Government, to be largely paid for by picric
acid, large contracts were entered into by our Government for this
explosive, which was produced here in accordance with French specifications
and subject to joint inspection by our officers and the
French.</p>

<p>In November, 1917, we were turning out 600,000 pounds of picric
acid monthly, and a year later this had been increased to a monthly
production of 11,300,000 pounds; the average cost was 56 cents a
pound.</p>

<p>To insure production quickly for the needs of the times, three Government
picric-acid plants were authorized. One of these was located
at Picron, near Little Rock, Ark., to be operated by the Davis Chemical
Corporation; another was located at New Brunswick, Ga., to be
operated by the Butterworth-Judson Corporation; and the third was
located at Grand Rapids, Mich., for operation by the Semet-Solvay Co.
All of these contracts were made on a cost-plus basis. Each of these
plants was to have a capacity of 14,500,000 pounds of picric acid a
month. The plant at Picron in Arkansas was the only one that had
started production before the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>Ammonium picrate, otherwise known as explosive D in our Army
annals, is produced by the ammoniation of picric acid, and because
it is more insensitive than picric acid and is less liable to form sensitive
salts with metals it is used as the explosive charge for all armor-piercing
projectiles.</p>

<p>Our average monthly production of ammonium picrate in May,
1917, was 53,000 pounds, and this had been increased without the
erection of any Government plants to a monthly capacity in November,
1918, of 950,000 pounds. There was on hand at the time of the
signing of the armistice 6,500,000 pounds of this explosive, the average
cost of which was 64 cents a pound.</p>

<p>Tetryl, on account of its high cost and the lack of manufacturing
facilities for its production, was not used except as a loading charge
for boosters. It is more sensitive than T. N. T. and has a higher rate
of detonation.</p>

<p>Only two companies, the du Pont Powder Co. and the Bethlehem
Loading Co., manufactured tetryl. Expansion of these two
plants increased the monthly capacity of 8,700 pounds in December,
1917, to 160,000 pounds in November, 1918, while its cost was reduced
from $1.30 a pound to 90 cents a pound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>This increased capacity, however, was not in excess of our explosives
requirements, and there was authorized by the Government the
erection of a plant at Senter, Mich., that was to be operated by the
Atlas Co., and which was to have a monthly capacity of 250,000
pounds. This plant had not reached production when the armistice
was signed.</p>

<p>The Aetna Powder Co. at the time we entered the war was manufacturing
for the Russian Government tetranitroaniline that was to
be used in the loading of boosters and fuses. This company's plant
at Nobleston, Pa., was destroyed by an explosion. Ordnance officers
learned that this material was equal to tetryl as a military explosive.
Consequently a contract was entered into with Dr. Bernhardt
Jacques Flurschein, the holder of the patent rights, to have
manufactured T. N. A. for our own uses. A Government plant was
authorized for erection on the ground of the Calco Chemical Co.,
Bound Brook, N.J., to be operated by that concern. Production at
this plant was to be on a cost-plus basis, the estimated cost of the
material being 70 cents a pound. When the armistice was signed,
about 8,000 pounds of T. N. A. had been produced, but none had
been utilized.</p>

<p>Mercury fulminate, a very sensitive and powerful explosive, was
used only in caps, primers, detonators, etc., as a means of initiating
detonation, on account of its own high rate of detonation. The
three plants operating in this country to produce this explosive for
commercial purposes, the du Pont Co., Pompton Lake, N.J., the
Atlas Powder Co., Tamaqua, Pa., and the Aetna Powder Co., Kingston,
N.Y., expanded their facilities sufficiently to meet our program.
Their average monthly production in 1918 was 50,000 pounds at a
cost of $3.21 per pound, and there was on hand in November, 1918,
330,900 pounds of this explosive.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the war to meet the apparent shortage of
T. N. T. and ammonium nitrate then existing because of our enormous
explosives program, it was necessary to develop an explosive for
trench warfare purposes that could be used for filling hand and
rifle grenades, trench-mortar shell, and drop bombs. To meet this
need, the Trojan Powder Co., of Allentown, Pa., submitted a nitrostarch
explosive. After exhaustive investigations and complete
tests, this explosive was authorized for use in loading the hand and
rifle grenades and the 3-inch trench-mortar shell.</p>

<p>Development of a nitrostarch explosive for commercial purposes
had been under consideration and investigation by two other large
experienced manufacturers for a number of years, but the difficulties
incident to the production and purification of nitrostarch were such
that their efforts had met with little success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The Trojan Powder Co., operating under secret process, solved this
problem, and all nitrostarch explosives used were produced by this
company, although another nitrostarch explosive known as "grenite,"
which was produced by the du Pont Co., was tested and authorized
for use.</p>

<p>Our country was the only Government that used nitrostarch
explosives during the war, and the development of this explosive
made the loading problem easier and made possible the use of
materials that were available and whose cost was low. The average
cost of this explosive was 21.8 cents a pound. In July, 1918,
the average monthly production of nitrostarch was 840,000 pounds
and this had been increased by November, 1918, to 1,720,000 pounds
a month.</p>

<p>There were loaded with nitrostarch explosive 7,244,569 defensive
hand grenades; 1,526,000 offensive hand grenades; 9,921,533
rifle grenades and 813,073 three-inch trench-mortar shell. At the time
of the signing of the armistice there was on hand of this explosive
1,650,500 pounds.</p>

<p>The du Pont Co. developed an explosive called lyconite, and
this was authorized for use in the loading of drop bombs.</p>

<p>Anilite, a liquid explosive used by the French, was thoroughly
investigated and improvements were made in it to render its use
safer, but development had not progressed far enough to warrant
authorization for its use prior to the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>Chlorate and perchlorate explosives were also investigated and
several types developed that were considered entirely satisfactory for
use, but these never got into production before the end of the war.</p>


<h4>AMMUNITION AND SHELL LOADING.</h4>

<p>When we entered the war the quantity of field artillery ammunition
on hand was considerably less than a single month's supply, basing
our rate of expenditure on the estimated rate for November, 1918.
There were no facilities of any degree of magnitude available to
take care of our projected program for filling the high-explosive
shell necessary for use by our overseas forces.</p>

<p>Consequently it became necessary at once to plan and to develop
the resources of the country for the production of metallic parts,
such as the shell proper, the fuse, boosters and adapters, as well as to
design and build entirely new plants and to train completely new forces
for the loading of the shell with the high explosives.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The explosion of an H. E. shell is really a series of explosions. The
process of the burst is about as follows: The firing pin strikes the
percussion primer, which explodes the detonator. The detonator is
filled with some easily detonated substance, such as fulminate of
mercury. The concussion of this explosion sets off the charge held
within the long tube which extends down the middle of the shell and
which is known as the booster. The booster charge is a substance
easily exploded, such as tetryl or trinitroaniline (T. N. A.). The explosion
of the booster jars off the main charge of the shell, T. N. T. or
amatol. This system of detonator, booster, and main charge gives
control of the explosives within the shell, safety in handling the shell,
and complete explosion when the shell bursts. Without the action
of the booster charge on the main charge of the shell, the latter would
be only partially burned when the shell exploded, and part of the
main charge would thus waste itself in the open air.</p>

<p>The shell used by our Army before the war had been largely of the
base-fuse type. Interchangeability of ammunition with the French
required that we adopt shell of the nose-fuse type. The boosters and
adapters that went with this type were unfamiliar to our industry.</p>

<p>The adapter is the metallic device that holds the booster and fuse
and fastens them in the shell. The adapter, therefore, is a broad
ring, screw-threaded both outside and inside. The inside diameter
is uniform, so as to allow the same size of booster and fuse to be
screwed into shell of different sizes. The outside diameters of the
adapters vary with the sizes of the shell they are made to fit, the rings
thus being thicker or thinner as the case may require. Fuses of
several sorts are employed by the modern artillerist; and with shell
equipped with adapters, any fuse may be inserted in the field right at
the gun.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the manufacture of boosters and adapters proved to
be much more difficult than it appeared to be at the start, and the
shortage of these devices was a limiting factor in the American production
of shell.</p>

<p>On May 1, 1917, drawings and specifications were sent to the principal
manufacturers of ammunition and ammunition components
inviting bids on 3-inch ammunition. These bids were opened on
May 15, 1917, and after full discussion with the Council of National
Defense orders were placed for 9,000,000 rounds of 3-inch shell and
shrapnel ammunition. The bids for shell and shrapnel ammunition
for all the other calibers of guns and howitzers we had on hand then
were about to be asked, when the French mission to this country
arrived; and the sending out of proposals was deferred, while discussion
ensued as to changing our 3-inch and 6-inch artillery to 75-millimeter
and 155-millimeter calibers, so as to make our ammunition
interchangeable with that of the French. This decision was made
June 5, 1917.</p>

<p>There then took place much discussion and consideration of the
French ammunition. The French had several distinct types of shell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
ranging from the very thin walled high capacity kind to the thicker
walled types. The French specifications were radically different
from our own or those of the British. The steel shell in the French
practice was subjected to a drastic heat treatment, which did not
seem necessary to us for the thicker walled types of shell.</p>

<p>The French fusing system also was entirely different from that used
by our service. French fuses were carried separately, and the adapter
and the booster casing were screwed permanently into the shell.</p>

<p>Our decision to adopt French types of ammunition made it necessary
to rearrange all our plans, and to obtain drawings of the shell,
boosters, adapters, and fuses from France. This caused much
negotiating, and a considerable amount of time was consumed in
getting the necessary specifications and drawings here.</p>

<p>As a result of recommendations from French officials against production
in this country during 1917 of the so-called "<i>obus allong&eacute;</i>"
and the semisteel type of shell, no attempt was made to produce these
for the 155-millimeter guns and howitzers during the first year of the
war, but as a result of new recommendations and investigations of
our officers in France in the spring of 1918 both of these types of
shell were put into quantity production here. When the armistice
was signed they were being turned out in such quantities that it
appeared that there was sure to be an ample supply on hand in the
early spring of 1919.</p>

<p>Radical differences of manufacture existed between the French and
British in the matter of specifications and methods of production.
Large quantities of British ammunition had been made in this
country, and we had adopted the British 8-inch howitzer, so that it
appeared we should use British practice in the manufacture of shell.
Manufacturers claimed that great delay would result in the production
of shell here if the heat treatment and hydraulic tests were insisted
upon as the French specifications called for, and investigation
proved this to be essentially true, as no facilities for heat treating and
hydraulic testing existed.</p>

<p>The upshot of the entire matter was that it was decided to use
French dimensions and shell for the 75-millimeter and 155-millimeter
calibers so as to obtain uniformity of ballistics, but to permit American
metallurgical practice to obtain in the manufacture. Shells made
under these specifications were tested by the French commission in
France. The verdict on these shell can be summarized in this quotation
from their report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To sum up, from the test of 10,000 cartridges of 75 millimeter, it may be concluded
that American ammunition is in every way comparable to French ammunition and
that the two may be considered as interchangeable.</p></div>

<p>Our designs for shrapnel and time fuses had been proven to be
entirely satisfactory, and they were continued as they were. In fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
it was generally agreed that ours was the best time fuse used on the
allied side during the war. That our decision in the matter of continuing
production of shrapnel and time fuses was warranted, is borne out
by the fact that we obtained early deliveries in sufficient quantities
to meet requirements.</p>

<p>In the use of the adapters and boosters, which introduced an entirely
new component to our service in shell making, we had had no
experience, and subsequently met with great difficulties due to this
lack of experience. Delays were encountered because in this part
of shell manufacture it was generally necessary to await information
from France whenever difficulties were encountered, or to conduct
experiments before we could proceed.</p>

<p>When we began receiving our bids for 3-inch gun ammunition
there were comparatively few factories in the United States that
were able to turn out complete rounds of ammunition. There were
many factories, however, capable of turning out one or more of the
shell components. It was necessary to place orders for complete
rounds of ammunition with those factories that could furnish them,
and have the remaining components manufactured separately, and to
provide assembling plants. To get as many factories as possible on
a production basis in anticipation of the future large orders for ammunition
that must necessarily follow with extension of operations by
our field forces, orders for our initial quantities of ammunition were
distributed as widely as possible.</p>

<p>To prevent confusion and loss of time because of the scramble for
steel forgings and other raw materials it was decided that the Government
would purchase all raw materials as well as furnish components
for ammunition.</p>

<p>How successful we were in getting into quantity production on
ammunition after the numerous and large obstacles in the early
months of the war can be indicated best by the fact that of the
11,616,156 high-explosive shell for 75-millimeter guns machined up
to November 1, no less than 2,893,367 passed inspection in October;
while of the 7,345,366 adapters and boosters for 75-millimeter guns
that had been machined up to the 1st of November, 2,758,397 passed
inspection in October.</p>

<p>Ammonium picrate or explosive D upon which this country had
depended almost entirely up to the time of our entry into the war was
forced into the shell under hydraulic pressure. The adoption of the
point-fused shell and an explosive for shell filling new to this country,
namely, amatol, made necessary the provision of new methods for
shell loading and the expansion of plant facilities for these new
methods capable of loading the vast and tremendous numbers of shell
required in modern warfare. As a result of reports, following
investigations by our officers of methods used abroad, various new
shell-loading plants were built in the United States.</p>

country are as follows:</p>

<p>It was found necessary in the early stages of the war to fill all shell
with T. N. T., regardless of cost, until there could be built the required
and properly equipped plants for the mixing and loading of amatol.</p>

<p>Two methods for loading T. N. T. were adopted. The one most
largely used, however, was the casting method by which the chemical
was brought to a molten condition in a steam jacketed kettle and
poured into the shell. To do this two operations were usual. First,
the shell was filled approximately two-thirds full with the molten
material, and then as soon as a crust was formed this was broken
through and the second filling took place. This process was necessary
to prevent the formation of cavities in the filling charge. Such cavities
cause breakdowns, resulting almost invariably in incomplete or
entire failure of detonation.</p>

<p>The ammonium nitrate first produced in this country during the
war was of such a character that proper densities could not be
obtained when mixed with T. N. T. to form amatol. This difficulty
was overcome after much investigation, and proper methods were
outlined for the ammonium nitrate manufacturers, with the result
that Grade III ammonium nitrate was produced as a sharp, hard
crystal at a setting point of not less than 290&deg; F. This was found
to be perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The so-called 50-50 amatol, composed of 50 parts ammonium
nitrate and 50 parts T. N. T., is loaded into shell by a casting method
similar to that used in loading T. N. T. alone.</p>

<p>The so-called 80-20 amatol, composed of 80 parts ammonium
nitrate and 20 parts T. N. T., was originally loaded cold, by hand, and
then followed up with mechanical pressing. As a substitute for this
method, which is accompanied by a certain element of danger, the use
of hot 80-20 amatol, was resorted to in England. This was tamped
by hand to the proper density, it being more compressible than cold
amatol.</p>

<p>As this is an exceedingly tedious method of operation it was
entirely done away with in England, except for large shell, by the use
of what is known as the horizontal extruding machine. With this
machine the British were able to load 80-20 amatol with great
success into the 75-millimeter shell and higher calibers up to 8
inches.</p>

<p>This machine took a mixture of T. N. T. and ammonium nitrate in a
jacketed hopper, so that the temperature might be maintained, and
the hopper fed it down through a funnel upon a screw that was
placed against the shell by counterweights to give the proper density.
One of these machines was imported here from England, but, as it was
unsatisfactory from a construction standpoint, new and satisfactory
machines were built on the same principles of construction in our
own amatol loading plants.</p>

<p>Experimental work with these machines was carried on at the
Government testing station Picatinny Arsenal, Dover, N. J., and the
du Pont Experimental Station, Gibbstown, N. J., as well as experimental
plant operations at the Morgan plant of the T. A. Gillespie Co.,
Parlin, N. J., and the Penniman plant of the du Pont Co., Penniman,
Va. All difficulties of the operations were overcome so satisfactorily
that the greater portion of the loaded shell was produced by this
method.</p>

<p>The metal parts as received at the shell-filling plant are inspected
and cleaned to remove all traces of foreign matter such as grit or
grease before being sent to the loading room. After being loaded the
shell are again inspected. At intervals a split shell is loaded and
then taken apart and examined, so that any loading defects may be
found quickly and conditions remedied, before any large quantities of
shell are produced.</p>

<p>The cavity left in the amatol by the tube of the extruding machine
is filled with molten T. N. T., and a cavity is produced in this T. N. T.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
into which the booster fits. This is necessary in order to provide for
complete detonation. The booster cavity is produced either by the
use of a former, which upon removal leaves a cavity of the proper
size, or by plunging the booster into the shell filling before this is
cooled, or by drilling out a cavity for the booster after the filling has
been thoroughly cooled.</p>

<p>A large number of rounds of ammunition of all calibers had also
to be loaded with a flashless compound that was inserted in the propelling
charges, so that the discharge of the guns would not betray
their positions to the enemy at night, while a smoke compound was
inserted in a large quantity of shell so that each missile of this character
might be located after firing to determine the accuracy of the
shot.</p>

<p>Coordination of manufacture of metallic parts so as to cause the
proper quantities of shell, fuse, and boosters to be produced without
leaving any incomplete rounds that would have to be held awaiting
other components caused the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the task of providing the necessary shell components
in the tremendous quantities required can be better appreciated
by a realization of the fact that the various parts of each component
must be made to fit each other properly and perfectly.
Gauging had to be resorted to frequently in the process of manufacture
to make certain that there was perfect interchangeability of
parts of each component to prevent any waste of time in selecting
parts to fit each other.</p>

<p>The complete components, too, must themselves be made with
equal care and scrupulous attention to make certain that they
fit properly. Thus, the booster had to be made in such a fashion
and with such precision and accuracy that it would fit perfectly into
the shell as well as into the booster cavity in the shell filling into
which it is screwed and also at the same time accommodate the fuse
which screws into the booster.</p>

<p>This extreme accuracy made necessary a large number of gauges,
which had to be designed at the same time as, and in coordination
with, the design of the component. For example, in a complete
round of artillery ammunition, 80 dimensions must be gauged.
To standardize the gauges used for these 80 dimensions, 180 master
gauges are required, while the actual number of different gauges used
during the various stages of manufacture of a complete round is over
500.</p>

<p>Government inspectors required over 200 gauges in their work of
inspecting and gauging the finished components for the shell, so in
all about 800 gauges were used in the process of manufacturing a
complete round of artillery ammunition, to insure interchangeability
of parts, proper fit for the projectile in the gun, and perfect functioning
of the various parts.</p>

<p>All fixed ammunition was assembled at the shell-filling plants,
making it necessary to install at these points storage capacity and
equipment to handle the propellant powder as well as to fill the high-explosive
shell. Boosters and fuses were loaded at separate plants
and shipped to the shell-filling assembly places to be packed for shipment
with the shell for transportation overseas.</p>

<p>The cost of a loaded 75-millimeter shell with the fuse and propellant
charge ready to be fired is about $11. Such a shell contains a little
over 1&frac12; pounds of high explosive, which costs $1. The loading and
assembling of the complete round costs $4.</p>

<p>A loaded 155-millimeter shell complete with fuse costs about $30,
exclusive of the propellant charge of powder, which is loaded separately.
A shell of this caliber holds about 14&frac14; pounds of high
explosive, which costs $10, while the loading and assembling costs $4.</p>

<p>The 75-millimeter and 155-millimeter shell were used in the greatest
quantities on the European battle fields, and at the time of the signing
of the armistice our American loading plants were concentrating
on filling ammunition for guns of these two calibers.</p>

<p>The nature of the work carried on at these shell-loading plants,
of course, made the danger of a disaster ever present. Prior to our
entry into the war an explosion at the Canadian Car &amp; Foundry Co.'s
plant, Kingsland, N. J., resulted in the entire destruction of the plant
with large loss of life.</p>

<p>In October, 1918, the Morgan plant of the T. A. Gillespie Co.,
South Amboy, N. J., was wiped out by an explosion in which about
100 employees lost their lives. Plans for rebuilding this plant, had
progressed far when the armistice was signed. In the fall of 1917,
40 people were killed in an explosion at the Eddystone Loading Plant,
Eddystone, Pa.</p>

<p>For the successful carrying out of our program for the production
of vast quantities of explosives and propellants, as well as shell
loading, the women of America must be given credit, on account
of the highly important part they took in this phase of helping to
win the war. Fully 50 per cent of the number of employees in our
explosive plants were women, who braved the dangers connected
with this line of work, to which they had been, of course, entirely
unaccustomed, but whose perils were not unknown to them.</p>

<p>In connection with the production of shell themselves, the American
Ordnance Department adopted certain changes of design which
were not only radically different from what we had known before
the war but were interesting for the way in which they were brought
about and for the results they accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>The modern shell as we knew it before the war was simply a metal
cylinder cut off squarely at the base and roundly blunted at the nose.
The shell is zoned with a so-called rotating ring, a circular band of
copper which by engaging the rifling channels of the gun gives to
the shell the whirl that keeps it from tumbling over and over and
thus holds it accurately on its course in flight.</p>

<p>In the proof-firing of the 6-inch seacoast guns it was discovered
that their fire was none too accurate; and the American ordnance
engineers began studying the shell to see if the fault lay there. One
of these experts was Maj. F. R. Moulton, who before accepting a
commission in the Army had been professor of astronomy at the
University of Chicago. Maj. Moulton began a study of the 6-inch
shell; and soon it was discovered that the mathematics which
could chart the orbits of comets could also deal with the flight of
projectiles, calculate the influences of air resistance and gravitation,
and eventually work out new, scientific contours for offsetting these
influences as much as possible.</p>

<p>Maj. Moulton first dealt with the inaccuracy of our 6-inch shell.
He discovered the cause in the rotating band. Although but a slight
portion of this band was upraised above the surface of the shell's
circumference, yet the enormous force exerted upon the projectile to
start it from the gun actually caused the cold copper to "flow"
backward. The result was that when the shell emerged from the
muzzle of the gun it bore around its sides an entirely unsuspected
and undesirable flange. This flange not only shortened the range of
the shell by offering resistance to the air, but it was seldom uniform
all the way around, a condition giving rise to the idiosyncracies of
our 6-inch shell as they were fired at the target.</p>

<p>The remedy for this was a redesigned rotating band, making it
somewhat thicker in front. The "flow" of the copper could thus be
accommodated without causing any detrimental distortion to the
projectile. When this improvement was made the 6-inch shell became
as accurate as any.</p>

<p>But Maj. Moulton was to make an even greater contribution to the
6-inch shell. This shell, like those of our other types, was square
ended at the base. Maj. Moulton in his new design tapered in the
sides somewhat, making the shell "boat ended." He elongated the
nose, bringing it out to a much sharper point. The result was the
first American "streamline" design for a shell. Shell of this new
model were built experimentally and tested. The 6-inch gun could
fire its old shell 17,000 yards, while the streamline shell went 4,000 or
5,000 yards farther&mdash;2 or 3 miles added to the range of an already
powerful weapon by the application of brains and mathematics.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The limiting factor in the development of light field guns has always been the
continuous hauling power of 6 horses, which is about 4,000 pounds. The gun has
been as powerful as possible within the limits of this weight, which includes the
carriage and limber as well as the cannon itself. Improved technique and materials
have reduced the necessary weight of the cannon from 1,650 pounds in 1815 to about
800 pounds to-day, permitting the use of weight for recoil mechanism and shield of
armor plate without exceeding the limit.</p>

<p>The 800-pound nickel-steel gun of 1918 fires as heavy a projectile (12-15 pounds)
as the 1,650-pound bronze gun of the Napoleonic wars. The improved material permits
a more powerful propellant charge, which results in greater muzzle velocity, a
flatter trajectory, and longer maximum range. The latter is due in part also to improved
shapes of projectiles and the introduction of rifling. The efficiency of artillery
is further increased by the introduction of high-explosive bursting charge. The
modern 75-millimeter shell contains about 1.76 pounds of high explosive as against
about 0.5 pound of black powder in shell prior to 1893.</p>

<p>The French were experimenting with streamline shell. We adopted
the French streamline 75-millimeter shell and put it into production,
calling it our Mark IV shell. Our regular 75-millimeter shell, known
as the Mark I 1900 shell, had a maximum range of 9,000 yards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Mark IV shell proved to have a maximum range of 12,130 yards,
giving an increase in range of well over a mile. America up to April
3, 1919, turned out about 524,000 of these streamline shell.</p>

<p>The French also built shell of semisteel, steel to which iron was
added. It was claimed that these shell, by bursting into fine fragments
upon exploding, were more effective against troops than all-steel
shell, because the fragments of the latter were larger. We
adopted this shell also and produced it experimentally. In contour
it was a compromise between the old cylindrical shell and the extreme
streamline type and was easier to make than the latter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

SIGHTS AND FIRE-CONTROL APPARATUS.</h3>


<p>At the threshold of the war with Germany we were confronted
with the problem of providing on a large scale those instruments of
precision with which modern artillerists point their weapons. As
mysterious to the average man as the sextant and other instruments
which help the navigator to bring his ship unerringly to port over
leagues of pathless water, or as those devices with which the surveyor
strikes a level through a range of mountains, are the instruments
which enable the gunner to drop a heavy projectile exactly on his
target without seeing it at all.</p>

<p>The old days of sighting a cannon point-blank at the visible enemy
over the open sights on the barrel of the weapon passed with the
Civil War. As the power of guns increased and their ranges lengthened,
the artillerists began firing at objects actually below the horizon
or hidden by intervening obstacles. These conditions necessarily
brought in the method of mathematical aim which is known as
indirect fire.</p>

<p>In the great war indirect firing was so perfected that within a few
seconds after an aviator or an observer in a captive balloon had
definitely located an enemy battery, that battery was deluged with
an avalanche of high-explosive shell and destroyed, even though
the attacking gunners were located several miles away and hills and
forests intervened to obscure the target from view. With the aid of
correlated maps in the possession of the battery gunners and the
aerial observer, a mere whisper of the wireless sufficed to turn a torrent
of shell precisely upon the enemy position which had just been
discovered. So accurate had indirect artillery fire become that a steel
wall of missiles could be laid down a few yards ahead of a body of
troops advancing on a broad front, and this wall could be kept moving
steadily ahead of the soldiers at a walking pace with few accidents
due to inaccurate control of the guns firing the barrage.</p>

<p>The chief difference between the old and the new methods of artillery
practice is the degree of precision attained. At the time of the
Civil War the artillery was fired relatively blindly, reliance being
placed upon the weight of the fire regardless of its accuracy and its
effectiveness; but modern artillery has recognized the importance of
the well-placed shot and demands instruments that must be marvels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of accuracy, since a slight error in the aiming at modern ranges means
a miss and the total loss of the shot. Such uncanny accuracy is
made possible by the use of those instruments of precision known as
fire-control apparatus. The gunner who is not equipped with proper
fire-control instruments can not aim correctly and is placed at a
serious disadvantage in the presence of the enemy. These instruments
must not only be as exact as a chronometer, but they must be
sufficiently rugged to withstand the concussion of close artillery fire.</p>

<p>Equipment classified under "Sights and fire-control apparatus"
comprises all devices to direct the fire of offensive weapons and to
observe the effect of this fire in order to place it on the target.
Included in this list are instruments of a surveying nature which
serve to locate the relative position of the target on the field of battle
and to determine its range. For this purpose the artillery officer
uses aiming circles, azimuth instruments, battery commander telescopes,
prismatic compasses, plotting boards, and other instruments.
Telescopes and field glasses equipped with measuring scales in them
are also employed in making observations.</p>

<p>Instruments of a second group are attached directly to the gun to
train it both horizontally and vertically in the directions given by the
battery commander. These devices include sights of different types,
elevation quadrants, clinometers, and other instruments. The intricate
panoramic sight which is used especially in firing at an unseen
target is one of the most important instruments of this group.</p>

<p>Still another set of instruments comprises devices such as range
deflection boards, deviation boards, and wind indicators which,
together with range tables and other tables, assist the battery commander
to ascertain the path of the projectile under any condition of
range, altitude, air pressure, temperature, and other physical influences.
When it is understood that the projectile fired by such a weapon as
the German long-range gun which bombarded Paris at a distance of
70 miles mounts so high into the air that it passes into the highly
rarified layers of the air envelope surrounding the earth and thus into
entirely different conditions of air pressure, it can be realized how
abstruse these range calculations are and how many factors must be
taken into account. The fire-control equipment enables the artilleryman
to make these computations quickly.</p>

<p>In addition to the above items many auxiliary devices are needed
by the Artillery, notable among these being the self-luminous aiming
posts and other arrangements which enable the gunners to maintain
accuracy of fire at night. This whole elaborate set of instruments
is supplied to the field and railway artillery&mdash;the big guns&mdash;and in
part to trench-mortar batteries and even to machine guns, which
in the latter months of the war were used in indirect firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Still another group of pointing instruments is used by antiaircraft
guns against hostile aircraft to ascertain their altitude, their
speed, and their future location in order that projectiles fired by the
antiaircraft guns may hit these high and rapidly moving targets.
Sights are also used on the airplanes themselves to aid the pilot
and the observer in the dropping of bombs and in gunfire against
enemy planes or targets. One of these sights corrects automatically
for the speed and direction of the airplane.</p>

<p>Fuse setters, which enable the gunner to time the fuse in the shell
so that the projectile moving with enormous speed explodes at
precisely the desired point, were required in large numbers.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the design, procurement, production, inspection,
and supply of the above equipment to the American Expeditionary
Forces was lodged in the Ordnance Department. The
effectiveness of the artillery on the field of battle depended directly
on the fire-control equipment furnished by this bureau.</p>

<p>The optical industry in this country before the war was in the
hands of a few firms. Several of these were under German influence,
and one firm was directly affiliated with the Carl Zeiss Works, of
Jena, Germany; the workmen were largely Germans or of German
origin; the kinds and design of apparatus produced were for the
most part essentially European in character; optical glass was procured
entirely from abroad and chiefly from Germany.</p>

<p>It was easier and cheaper for manufacturers to order glass from
abroad than to develop its manufacture in this country. Educational
and research institutions obtained a large part of their equipment
from Germany and offered no special inducement for American
manufacturers to provide such apparatus. Duty-free importation
favored and encouraged this dependence on Germany for scientific
apparatus.</p>

<p>With our entrance in the war the European sources of supply
for optical glass and optical instruments were cut off abruptly and
we were brought face to face with the problem of furnishing these
items to the Army and Navy for use in the field. Prior to 1917 only
three private manufacturers in the United States had built fire-control
apparatus in any quantity for the Government. The Bausch
&amp; Lomb Optical Co., Rochester, N. Y., had made range finders and
field glasses for the Artillery and Infantry, and gun sights, range finders,
and spy glasses and field glasses for the Navy; the Keuffel &amp; Esser
Co., Hoboken, N. J., had produced some fire-control equipment for
the Navy; the Warner &amp; Swasey Co., Cleveland, Ohio, with J. A.
Brashear, Pittsburgh, Pa., had furnished depression-position finders,
azimuth instruments, and telescopic musket sights to the Army.
The only other source of supply in this country had been the Frankford
Arsenal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Prior to 1917 the largest order for fire-control equipment which our
Army had ever placed in a single year amounted to $1,202,000. The
total orders for such instruments placed by the Ordnance Department
alone during the 19 months of war exceeded $50,000,000, while the
total orders for fire-control apparatus placed by the Army and Navy
exceeded $100,000,000.</p>

<p>To meet the situation, existing facilities had to be increased, new
facilities developed, and other, allied, industries converted to the production
of fire-control material.</p>

<p>Quantity production had to be secured through the assembling of
standardized parts of instruments which heretofore had either never
been built in this country or only in a small, experimental way. A
large part of the work had of necessity to be done by machines
operated by relatively unskilled labor. The manufacturing tolerances
had to be nicely adjusted between the different parts of each instrument,
so that wherever less precise work would answer the purpose the
production methods were arranged accordingly. Only by a careful
coordination of design, factory operations, and field performance
could quantity production of the desired quality be obtained in a
short time. Speed of production meant everything if our troops in
the field were to be equipped with the necessary fire-control apparatus
and thus enabled to meet the enemy on even approximately equal
terms.</p>

<p>To accomplish this object a competent personnel within the Army
had to be organized and developed; the Army requirements had to be
carefully scrutinized and coordinated with reference to relative urgency;
manufacturers had to be encouraged to undertake new tasks
and to be impressed with the necessity for whole-hearted cooperation
and with the importance of their part in the war; raw materials
had to be secured and their transportation assured. These and other
factors were faced and overcome.</p>

<p>Although American fire-control instruments did not reach the front
in as large numbers as were wanted, great quantities were under way,
and we had attained in the manufacturing program a basic stage
of progress which would have cared for all of our needs in the spring
and summer of 1919. Incidentally there has been developed in this
country a manufacturing capacity for precision optical and instrument
work, which, if desired, will render us independent of foreign markets.
At the present time there exists in this country a trained personnel
and adequate organization for the production of precision optical
instruments greatly in excess of the needs of the country. One of the
problems which we now have to consider is the conversion of this
development brought about by war-time conditions into channels of
peace-time activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>At the present time American manufacturers are in a position to
make instruments of precision equal to the best European product,
and the industry will continue, provided there is an adequate market
for its product. Such a market will exist if the universities and commercial
laboratories of the country will obtain scientific apparatus
from American manufacturers rather than import it from abroad as
has heretofore been the custom.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, the most serious problem in the situation was the
manufacture of optical glass. Prior to 1914 practically all of the optical
glass used in the United States had been imported from abroad;
manufacturers followed the line of least resistance and preferred to
procure certain commodities, such as optical glass, chemical dyes,
and other materials difficult to produce, direct from Europe rather
than to undertake their manufacture here. The war stopped this
source of supply abruptly, and in 1915 experiments on the making of
optical glass were under way at five different plants&mdash;the Bausch &amp;
Lomb Optical Co. at Rochester N. Y.; the Bureau of Standards at
Pittsburgh, Pa.; the Keuffel &amp; Esser Co. at Hoboken, N. J.; the
Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. at Charleroi, Pa.; the Spencer Lens Co.
at Hamburg, Buffalo, N. Y.</p>

<p>By April, 1917, the situation had become acute; some optical
glass of fair quality had been produced, but nowhere had its manufacture
been placed on an assured basis. The glass-making processes
were not adequately known. Without optical glass fire-control
instruments could not be produced; optical glass is a thing
of high precision and in its manufacture accurate control is required
throughout the factory processes. In this emergency the Government
appealed to the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington for assistance.</p>

<p>This laboratory had been engaged for many years in the study of
solutions, such as that of optical glass, at high temperatures and had
a corps of scientists trained along the lines essential to the successful
production of optical glass. It was the only organization in the
country with a personnel adequate and competent to undertake a
manufacturing problem of this character and magnitude. Accordingly,
in April, 1917, a group of its scientists was placed at the Bausch
&amp; Lomb Optical Co. and given virtual charge of the plant; its men
were assigned to the different factory operations and made responsible
for them. By November, 1917, the manufacturing processes at
this plant had been mastered and large quantities of optical glass
of good quality were being produced. In December, 1917, the work
was extended, men from the Geophysical Laboratory taking practical
charge of the plants of the Spencer Lens Co. and of the Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Co.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The cost to the Geophysical Laboratory of contributing to the Government
the solution of the optical glass problem amounted to about
$200,000, but the results attained surely more than justified these
expenditures. These results could not have been attained, however,
without the hearty cooperation of the manufacturers and of the Army
and Navy, which assisted in the procurement and transportation of
the raw materials. An ordnance officer was in charge of the Rochester
party from the Geophysical Laboratory and was responsible for
much of the pioneer development work accomplished there. It was
at this plant, that of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. at Rochester,
that the methods of manufacture were first developed and
placed on a production basis. The Bureau of Standards aided in
the development of a chemically and thermally resistant crucible
in which to melt optical glass; also in the testing of optical glass,
and especially in the testing of optical instruments. The Geological
Survey aided in locating sources of raw materials, such as sand of
adequate chemical purity.</p>

<p>By February, 1918, the supply of optical glass was assured; but
the manufacture of optical instruments was so seriously behind
schedule that a military optical glass and instrument section was
formed in the War Industries Board and took charge of the entire
optical instrument industry of the country. Through the efforts
of its chief, Mr. George E. Chatillon, of New York, the entire industry
was coordinated. By September, 1918, the production of fire-control
instruments in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements
of both the Army and Navy during 1919 was believed to be assured.</p>

<p>To the accomplishment of this result the Ordnance Department
contributed most effectively. The information and long experience
of Frankford Arsenal in instrument manufacture and in the work of precision
optics were placed at the service of contractors; trained officers of
the Ordnance Department were stationed at the different factories; in
many factories these officers rendered valuable aid in devising and
developing proper and adequate factory operations, in establishing
production on a satisfactory basis, in securing the proper inflow of
raw materials, in devising testing fixtures, in establishing proper manufacturing
tolerances, and in testing the performance of the assembled
instruments. Schools for operatives in precision optics were established
at Frankford Arsenal, Philadelphia, Pa., at Rochester, N. Y.,
and at Mount Wilson Observatory, Pasadena, Cal. To many contractors
financial aid had to be extended. The fire-control program
required, in short, all the available talent and resources of the
country to carry it to a successful finish.</p>

<p>The general procedure adopted by the Ordnance Department was
to assign the more difficult instruments to manufacturers who had
had experience along similar lines. To others, who had produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
articles allied only in a distant way to fire-control instruments, less
intricate types of instruments were awarded. In certain instances
the optical elements were produced by one firm, the mechanical
parts by another, the final assembly of the instrument being then
accomplished by the latter.</p>

<p>Because our Army had adopted a number of French guns for
reproduction here, it became necessary to build sights for these
weapons according to the French designs. This gave us much trouble,
not only because of the delay in securing samples and drawings from
France, but because of the difficulties in producing articles from
these French drawings by American methods and with American
workmen.</p>

<p>The most intricate of these French sights was the Schneider quadrant
sight. It was used with the French 155-millimeter gun, the
155-millimeter howitzer, and the 240-millimeter howitzer. The
structure of this sight was highly complicated, and extreme accuracy
was required at every stage of production. These sights were put
into production by the Emerson Engineering Co. of Philadelphia,
the Raymond Engineering Co. of New York, and by Slocum, Avram
&amp; Slocum of New York.</p>

<p>The design of this sight was received from France early in 1918,
yet it was the 1st of November&mdash;10 days before the armistice was
signed&mdash;when the first Schneider sight was delivered to the Army;
but at all times the progress made was as rapid as could be expected.
A total of 7,000 Schneider quadrant sights was ordered, which meant
a year's work for 1,000 men. Of this order 3,500 sights were to be
manufactured by the Schneider Co. in France and the rest by the
three firms in this country. On November 11 the American factories
had delivered 74 sights and since that time over 560 have been
completed.</p>

<p>The amount of labor involved in the case of Schneider quadrant
sights is shown by the fact that while the raw material for it cost about
$25, the finished sight is worth about $600. In order to expedite production
the Government extended financial assistance to some of the
factories to aid in the procurement and installation of additional
equipment. On November 11 the number of these sights completed
was short of requirements for installation on completed carriages by
about 400, but the rate of progress which had been attained in production
would have overtaken the output of gun carriages by
January 1, 1919.</p>

<p>Another difficult task was the construction of telescopic sights for
the French 37-millimeter guns, the "Infantry cannon" which we
adopted for reproduction in this country. Here again we encountered
the same difficulty of adapting French plans to our methods.
The original contract was placed with a firm which had had no ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>perience
with optical instruments of precision, but no other company
was available for the work. When by May, 1918, this concern had
produced only a few sights the contract was taken from it and placed
with a subcontractor, the Central Scientific Co., of Chicago, who had
been building mechanical parts for the sights. In this plant the
complete force had to be educated in the art before any production
could begin. When the armistice was signed the gun factories had
produced 884 of the 37-millimeter guns, but only 142 telescopic
sights had been completed. The rate of production of these sights
by the Central Scientific Co. was such, however, that the shortage
would have ceased to exist shortly after January 1, 1919.</p>

<p>The French design for the telescopic sight for the 37-millimeter
gun used on the tanks was also adopted by the Army. Here again
difficulty was experienced in manufacture, but excellent progress
was made especially by one firm (Burke &amp; James of Chicago, Ill.),
and the output in adequate quantities was assured for 1919. The
French collimator sight for the 75-millimeter gun presented difficulties
to the manufacturer, especially in the optical parts. These
were, however, overcome by the Globe Optical Co., who furnished
the optics to the Electric Auto-Lite Corporation and to the Standard
Thermometer Co. of Boston, with the result that at the time of
the signing of the armistice the production of these sights was
progressing well.</p>

<p>Periscopes from 20 inches to nearly 20 feet in length were produced
in quantity. These periscopes enabled the men in the front-line
trenches to look over the top with comparative safety. The long
periscopes were used in deep-shelter trenches and bomb proofs.
The production of the short-base periscopes and also of the battery
commanders' periscopes by the Wollensak Optical Co., Rochester,
N. Y., and of the 3-meter and 6-meter periscope by the Andrew J.
Lloyd Co. of Boston, Mass., was progressing at such a rate that the
needs of the Army for 1919 would be met on time.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war the policy followed by the Ordnance
Department was to place orders for standard fire-control apparatus,
such as range finders of different base lengths, battery commander
telescopes, aiming circles, panoramic sights, musket sights, and
prismatic compasses with firms of established reputation and experience.
The result was that when requests from the Army in France
came for instruments of new design, new sources of manufacture
had to be sought out and these organizations educated in the methods
of precision optics. Such a procedure necessarily caused delay, but
it was the only course of action left. Wherever possible part of the
total contract was awarded to an experienced manufacturer, so
that some production was assured.</p>

<p>The records show that the experienced manufacturers overcame
the difficulties encountered and had obtained in general a rate of
output which was satisfactory at the time of the signing of the
armistice. Thus the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co. had delivered
large numbers of range finders of base lengths of 80 centimeters, 1
meter and 15 feet, and battery commanders' telescopes; Keuffel
&amp; Esser had made many prismatic compasses and a few range
finders; the Spencer Lens Co. had produced aiming circles in quantity;
the Warner &amp; Swasey Co., with J. A. Brashear of Pittsburgh,
had furnished large numbers of the valuable panoramic sights with
which much of the artillery fire is directed. Much credit is due the
above organizations for the efficient manner in which they placed
the manufacture of these items on a high-speed production basis.
Frankford Arsenal proved to be a most reliable source of supply for
battery commander telescopes, panoramic sights, azimuth instruments
for 3-inch telescopes, plotting boards, and other ordnance
fire-control instruments.</p>

<p>The manufacture of many other types of instruments was undertaken
in this country. Among these the French sitogoniometer, a
device which assists the battery commander in obtaining data for
the direction of fire, was successfully produced by the Martin-Copeland
Co. of Providence, R. I.; quadrant sights for the 37-millimeter
gun by the Scientific Materials Co. of Pittsburgh; lensatic
compasses and Brunton compasses were furnished by Wm. Ainsworth
&amp; Sons of Denver, Colo.; prismatic compasses by the Sperry Gyroscope
Co. of Brooklyn, N. Y.; telescopes for sights on antiaircraft
carriages by the Kollmorgen Optical Corporation of Brooklyn;
altimeters, gunners' quadrants, elevation quadrants, and aiming
stakes by the J. H. Deagan Co. of Chicago, Ill.; panoramic telescopes
and fuse setters by the Recording &amp; Computing Machines Co. of
Dayton, Ohio; battery commander telescopes by Arthur Brock of
Philadelphia; tripods for fire-control instruments by the National
Cash Register Co. of Dayton, Ohio. Optics for different sights were
furnished by the American Optical Co. of Southbridge, Mass., and
by the Mount Wilson Observatory of Pasadena, Calif. These and
other organizations entered into the task and devoted their energy
to the production of equipment desired by the Government.</p>

<p>At no time during the fighting did our artillery units have a
sufficient supply of fire-control instruments. This was due to the
fact that we were not able to secure in Europe the amount of this
equipment required to take care of our needs while our own industry
was being developed.</p>

<p>With almost a total lack of optical glass in this country, with an
equal lack of factories and workmen familiar with military optical
instrument-making, we were suddenly called upon to produce about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
200 different types of instruments in large quantities. These
included many new designs of fire-control apparatus made necessary
by new artillery developments both among the allies and in our own
factories, by the adoption of trench warfare in place of open warfare,
by the development of weapons for use against aircraft, by the
extension of indirect fire-control methods to weapons which formerly
had been fired by direct sighting, and by the use of railway and
seacoast artillery.</p>

<p>While we did not solve all the difficulties in this development,
we had met and conquered the worst of them, and we were making
such great strides in production when the war ended that all the
requirements of the Army would have been met early in 1919. It
has been a source of inspiration to witness the high sense of patriotic
duty and cooperation shown by the manufacturers which made
possible the remarkable expansion of the optical glass and instrument
industry in the United States during the period of the war.</p>

<p>The following table shows the principal items of sights and fire-control
apparatus, the firms that did the work, the quantity of the
various kinds of instruments ordered, and the deliveries made up

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

MOTORIZED ARTILLERY.</h3>


<p>Complete motorization of field artillery and its ammunition supply
is almost certain to be one of the far-reaching and highly important
results of our country's experiences in its participation in the war.</p>

<p>Practically all field artillery was of the horse-drawn type previous
to our entry into the war, but with the evolution and perfection of
the heavier siege artillery, 5-ton, 10-ton, and even heavier, traction
engines were brought into play as means of motive power for the
big guns and howitzers, with such success that the horse in the field
artillery operations was being supplanted to a large degree by mechanical
power.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the foundation for this departure had been laid
before 1917, in the Mexican campaign of 1916 and in experiments
that had been conducted at the Rock Island Arsenal. Insufficiency
of funds, however, had prevented the experiments from being either
thorough or extensive.</p>

<p>A consideration of the difficulties that vehicles of all sorts had to
contend with in the battle areas of Europe made it evident at the
outset that two general types of motor carriers would be required
by the Army so far as ordnance was concerned&mdash;one type for far-advanced
work, for hauling artillery over the worst possible kind of
shell-torn and water-soaked earth, and the other for bringing up
ammunition, supplies, equipment for repairs and the like in less
advanced zones and areas, but over roads and country that had
been cut and hacked and made almost impassible by the activities
of the contending forces.</p>


<h4>TRUCKS.</h4>

<p>The standard four-wheel-drive commercial trucks, modified to
meet the special needs of the service, were adopted immediately after
war began, while experimental work was put under way to develop
a standard type that would set this country far in advance of all
others in this line of activity.</p>

<p>A total of 30,072 of the four-wheel-drive trucks was ordered, and
before the armistice 12,498 of this number had been completed,
while 23,499 had been turned out by the 31st of January, 1919.</p>

<p>In round numbers, 25,000 of these trucks were to be equipped with
bodies for the hauling of ammunition, and the balance with special
bodies and equipment suitable for artillery supply and repair, for
repair of equipment, and for heavy mobile ordnance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ARTILLERY SUPPLY TRUCK ON F. W. D. CHASSIS.</p>

<p>This truck was designed with special bodies and loads for varied classes of artillery supply,
and the bodies could be mounted on either Nash or F. W. D. chassis.</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Special bodies were manufactured by these concerns:</p>


<ul><li>American Car &amp; Foundry Co., Berwick, Pa.</li>
<li>J. G. Brill Co., Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
<li>Hale &amp; Kilburn Corporation, Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
<li>Dumbar Manufacturing Co., Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Pullman Co., Pullman, Ill.</li>
<li>Kuhlman Car Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>C. R. Wilson Body Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>Insley Manufacturing Co., Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>Lang Body Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>Heil Co., Milwaukee, Wis.</li>
<li>Variety Manufacturing Co., Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>J. E. Bolles Iron &amp; Wire Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first contract for these trucks was placed on August 18, 1917,
and 9,420 were shipped to the American Expeditionary Forces
overseas by the date of the armistice.</p>

<p>It required considerable time to work out and perfect all the details
of the special bodies and equipment, as most of these were exceedingly
complicated, and in a number of cases there were as many as 700
items of equipment on a single truck.</p>

<p>Representatives of the allied governments were not hesitant in
asserting that the line of artillery repair trucks developed for our
Army was the most complete and well worked out in detail that
any army ever received.</p>

<p>These manufacturers did the work of turning out the special
trucks:</p>


<ul><li>Nash Motors Co., Kenosha, Wis.</li>
<li>Four-Wheel-Drive Auto Co., Clintonville, Wis.</li>
<li>Mitchell Motor Car Co., Racine, Wis.</li>
<li>Premier Motor Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>Kissel Motor Car Co., Hartford, Wis.</li>
<li>Hudson Motor Car Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>National Motor Car Co., Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>Paige Motor Car Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>Commerce Motor Car Corporation, Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>White Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>Dodge Motor Car Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
</ul>

<p>About 4,000 of the 5,000 special body type of trucks were delivered
before the middle of December, 1918.</p>


<h4>TRAILERS.</h4>

<p>There were developed five different types of four-wheeled trailers.
Each type, being for a particular use, required a special study and
individual design, with all the consequent specially prepared machines
and specialized shop work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>For antiaircraft service, a 1&frac12;-ton and a 3-ton trailer were worked
out; for the 75-millimeter field gun, a special 3-ton trailer; for the
mobile repair shops, a 4-ton trailer; and for the small tank, a special
10-ton trailer.</p>

<p>By the middle of December, 2,157 of these trailers had been
delivered of the 4,847 that had been ordered and put in production.</p>

<p>Concerns engaged in turning out trailers were:</p>


<ul><li>Sechler &amp; Co., Cincinnati, Ohio.</li>
<li>Trailmobile Co. of America, Cincinnati, Ohio.</li>
<li>Ohio Trailer Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>Grant Motor Car Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might also be stated at this point, too, that two special types of
passenger motor vehicles were designed and built. One of these was
for staff observation and the other for reconnaissance. Nearly all of
the total of 2,250 that were ordered of these two types were completed
by mid-December, 1918, delivery of them having started in the month
of April, 1918.</p>


<h4>CATERPILLAR TRACTORS.</h4>

<p>It was found after a comprehensive study of the needs of the
various branches of ordnance and the requirement of the big guns
that five sizes of caterpillar tractors would be required&mdash;of capacities
of 2&frac12; tons, 5 tons, 10 tons, 15 tons, and 20 tons.</p>

<p>Commercial types of machines of the 15-ton and 20-ton sort, with
only slight alterations, were found to be suitable, but special designs
were made for those of 2&frac12;-ton, 5-ton, and 10-ton capacity. Our
experience in Mexico and the experiments at the Rock Island Arsenal
had taught us the need of the special designs of machines of those
sizes.</p>

<p>In all, 24,791 of these five types of caterpillar tractors were ordered.
The 5-ton machine reached production in the summer of 1918 and
the 2&frac12;-ton machine in the fall. By the end of the following January,
5,940 of the tractors had been delivered. Manufacturers who had
orders for the caterpillar tractors were:</p>


<ul><li>Holt Manufacturing Co., Peoria, Ill.</li>
<li>Chandler Motor Car Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>Reo Motor Car Co., Lansing, Mich.</li>
<li>Maxwell Motor Car Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>Federal Motor Truck Co., Detroit, Mich.</li>
<li>Interstate Motor Co., Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the production of tractors during the war period
there was continuous and persistent experimentation, and satisfactory
solutions of many of the problems were being reached at the
time of the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>Self-propelled caterpillar gun mounts were the subject of the most
important of these experiments. The self-propelled caterpillar gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mounts differ from the ordinary caterpillar tractors in that they have
the guns mounted directly on them, the guns forming an integral
part of the entire machine. Six types of these were being developed,
and 270 had been ordered when the armistice came.</p>

<p>A 2&frac12;-ton tractor mounting a 75-millimeter gun and a 5-ton tractor
containing a gun of the same size were far along the road to success
in their first state of development.</p>

<p>Development of caterpillar cargo carriers or caissons for bearing
supplies over any sort of terrain, no matter how rough the going might
be and regardless of whether there were roads or not, was so far along
the pathway of success that two sizes were about to go into production
on November 11.</p>

<p>A 2&frac12;-ton ammunition trailer, a 2-ton 11-inch trench mortar trailer,
and a 4.7-inch antiaircraft gun trailer were also in development, but
not in production, at the time of the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>So successful were the experiments with new types of four-wheel-drive
trucks and tractors that orders for what would probably
have proven the best type of four-wheel-drive truck and the best
type of four-wheel-drive tractor ever produced had been placed, but
the signing of the armistice forced cancellations of these orders. In
the course of the experiments, all types of American four-wheel-drive
vehicles were examined and two of the best French types.</p>

<p>The purchase of $365,000,000 worth of trucks, trailers, and tractors
was obligated in about 3,000 separate orders.</p>


<h4>SELF-PROPELLED CATERPILLAR GUN MOUNTS.</h4>

<p>In Europe, the French had been the only people to experiment
with caterpillar mounts for guns. They produced the St. Chamond
type, but this had not gone far beyond the experimental stages.</p>

<p>Prior to the early months of 1918, our own efforts along this line
consisted in the building of one caterpillar mount, self-propelled by
a gasoline engine and carrying an antiaircraft gun. Around this
nucleus an ambitious caterpillar program was built.</p>

<p>An 8-inch howitzer was placed on this antiaircraft caterpillar mount
and fired at angles of elevation varying up to 45&deg;. Maneuvered over
difficult ground, the machine withstood the firing strains and road
tests in a highly satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>As a result of the success of these tests, orders were placed for three
more experimental caterpillars to mount 8-inch howitzers. Tests of
two of these completed units were so gratifying that it was felt they
warranted quantity production. Accordingly, orders were placed for
50 units of the 8-inch howitzer caterpillars to cost about $30,000
apiece, for 50 caterpillar units mounting 155-millimeter guns, and for
250 units mounting 240-millimeter howitzers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The Standard Steel Car Co., Hammond, Ind., was to produce the
240-millimeter howitzer caterpillars, the Harrisburg Manufacturing
&amp; Boiler Co., Harrisburg, Pa., was to turn out the 8-inch howitzer
caterpillars, and the Morgan Engineering Co., of Alliance, Ohio, was
to produce the 155-millimeter gun caterpillars.</p>

<p>Mountings for the 8-inch howitzer and 155-millimeter gun were
practically identical. Both utilized many of the standard Holt
caterpillar parts. The only real change was in the carriage for the
155-millimeter gun. This was made sufficiently sturdy to carry higher-powered
guns. A 194-millimeter gun is now being machined in
France, and when finished it will be shipped to this country to be
mounted upon the 155-millimeter caterpillar mount for experiment.</p>

<p>The 240-millimeter howitzer mounts were of two types&mdash;one following
closely the St. Chamond type of the French and the other being
a self-contained unit designed by Ordnance Department engineers.
The self-contained type is a single unit that mounts both the
power plant and the howitzer and for which it is necessary to provide
additional cargo-carrying caterpillars to haul ammunition and fuel.
Two units make up the St. Chamond type. One mounts the gun
and electric motors; the other, a limber, mounts the power plant
and carries ammunition.</p>

<p>In the battle area the St. Chamond type had the peculiar advantage
that the power-plant unit could be run to shelter and be available
for a rapid advance or change of location of the gun mount as
the situation might demand. With the self-contained unit a direct
hit by the enemy would put both gun and power plant out of commission.</p>

<p>Contracts for the caterpillar mounts called for the completion of
the entire program not later than February, 1919. All the firms
engaged on the work of production were putting forth every effort
when the armistice was signed and there was every reason to believe
deliveries would be as scheduled. The termination of hostilities
caused all contracts to be reduced. Provisions have been made for
only enough caterpillars of each type to provide for further experimental
work.</p>

<p>Twenty mounts equipped with caterpillar treads and mounting
7-inch Navy rifles were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Co. for the
Navy Department. These were so successfully operated that orders
were placed for 36 similar units for the use of the Army, but since
the signing of the armistice this order has been cut to 18.</p>

<p>The great gun on a caterpillar mount fires its death-dealing projectile,
and almost before the shot has reached its destination the
caterpillar mount has moved the gun to another point. With motor
still running the gun is fired again and once more quickly moved
on to another location, so that the enemy's artillery is unable to get
its range.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

TANKS.</h3>


<p>The tank, more than any other weapon born of the great war, may
be called the joint enterprise of the three principal powers arrayed
against Germany&mdash;America, France, and Great Britain. An American
produced the fundamental invention, the caterpillar traction
device, which enables the fortress to move. A Frenchman took the
idea from this and evolved the tank as an engine of war. The
British first used the terrifying monster in actual fighting.</p>

<p>There is a common impression throughout America that the British
Army invented the tank. The impression is wrong in two ways.
The French government has recently awarded the ribbon of the
Legion of Honor to the French ordnance officer who is officially hailed
as the tank's inventor. His right to the honor, however, is disputed
by a French civilian who possesses an impressive exhibition of drawings
to prove that he and not the officer is the inventor. As this is
written a lively controversy over the point is in progress in France.
Wherever the credit for the invention belongs, the French were first
to build tanks, building them only experimentally, however, and not
using them until after the British had demonstrated their effectiveness.</p>

<p>In the second place, it was not the British Army which adopted
them first in England, but the British Navy. The tank as an idea
shared the experience of many another war invention in being
skeptically received by the conservative experts. The British Navy,
indeed, produced the first ones in England; but to the British Army
goes the glory of having first used them in actual fighting and of
establishing them in the forefront of modern offensive weapons.</p>

<p>Brought forth as a surprise, the tanks made an effective d&eacute;but in
the great British drive for Cambrai. Later the enemy affected to
scoff at their usefulness. The closing months of the tanks' brief
history, however, found them in greater favor than ever, and they
were used by both sides in increasing numbers.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of the summer of 1917 there was little accurate
information in this country regarding the tanks. Somewhat hazy
specifications then began to come from Europe about the designs of
the different tanks at that particular time in use on the battle front,
but these specifications were exceedingly rough and sketchy, consisting
in the main of merely the fact that the machines should be able to
cross trenches about 6 feet wide, that each should carry one heavy gun
and two or three machine guns, and that their protection should
consist of armor plate about five-eighths of an inch thick.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>This machine is practically a copy of the French Renault tank and carries two men (one driver, one gunner). About
half of these tanks were equipped with 37-millimeter cannon and about half with machine guns. Certain of
these tanks also made with wireless apparatus substituted for the turret of the fighting tanks. Power plant,
one Buda 4-cylinder motor; speed, five to six miles per hour; grade capacity, 45&deg;; weight, 15,000 pounds.</p></div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>With these facts as a guide, two experimental machines were
decided upon, and work on them was begun immediately. With these
machines it was determined to test the relative advantages of a
specially articulated form of caterpillar tractor with wheeled traction,
making use of very large wheels, and to develop the possibilities
between the gas-electric and steam systems of propulsion.</p>

<p>In September, 1917, decision had been made to supply the American
Army with two types of tanks&mdash;one the large size, typical of that used
by the British and capable of containing a dozen men, and the other
a smaller one patterned after the French two-man model and known
as the Renault. In September one of our officers charged with
tank production was dispatched to Europe for a more intimate
study of the machines used abroad and for the purpose of getting
more detailed information respecting the merits of the various
types of tanks, as well as to make arrangements for sending specimens
here.</p>

<p>The decision to equip the American forces in Europe with tanks of
two sizes was made only after thorough and somewhat protracted
conferences with British, French, and American officers in Europe.
Complete drawings and samples of the small tank were obtained from
the French and shipped to this country. As all of the drawings
were made in accordance with the metric system of measurements,
it was necessary before anything could be done toward actual production
to remake the drawings, as the machine shops here were
not equipped to use the metric system.</p>

<p>The large British tank had been successful in its operations on
the battle front, but its very decided limitations, recognized by
British authorities, caused our officers to think it best to redesign
the large tank in preference to copying the existing big British tank
with its limitations.</p>

<p>General "fighting" specifications for the big tank were laid down
by the British general staff at the conference at British headquarters
at which American officers were present. It was agreed that this
big tank, known as the Mark VIII, should be of Anglo-American
design and construction. Arrangements were made for producing
1,500 of this type. To do this, Great Britain and the United States
entered into a working agreement that provided for England to
furnish the hulls, guns, and ammunition, while the United States
was to furnish the power plant and driving details of the monster.
Roughly speaking, each tank would cost about $35,000, of which
$15,000 represented the American part of the job, on which some 72
contractors were at once engaged. About 50 per cent of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
on these tanks had been completed when the armistice was signed,
and the first units were undergoing trials.</p>

<p>It was confidently expected that all of the 1,500 contracted for
would have been completed by March, 1919. While these Anglo-American
tanks were in the process of construction there were also
being built here 1,450 all-American tanks of the large English type,
and for this all-American tank 50 per cent of the work had also
been done at the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, a sample French tank of the Renault type
reached this country along with detailed drawings and a French
engineer. Much difficulty then ensued in getting American concerns
to take on production of this machine, because of the difficult nature
of its manufacture. Considerable time, too, was taken up in changing
the drawings from the French metric dimensions to the American
dimensions, and this involved redesigning many parts.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of the armor built for the Renault type of
tank the French made no attempt to adhere to simple shapes, and
for this reason practically a new source of supply for this kind of
armor had to be developed. Contracts for 4,440 of the Renault type
of tanks were finally made. The approximate cost of each one of
these machines was $11,500. Manufacturing activities for the various
parts had to be divided up among more than a score of plants,
so that many plants were turning out parts for these machines, while
the assembling was done at only three plants, which also made a portion
of the parts.</p>

<p>The three assembly plants were the Van Dorn Iron Works, of
Cleveland, Ohio; the Maxwell Motors Co., of Dayton, Ohio; and the
C. L. Best Co., also of Dayton.</p>

<p>Finished machines of this type started to come through in October.
When the armistice was signed 64 of these 6-ton Renault tanks,
each designed to carry two men and a machine gun, were completed,
while up to the end of December the number of those finished
amounted to 209, with 289 in the process of assembly. There is
every reason to believe that had the armistice not been signed, the
entire original program would have been completed by April.</p>

<p>During the summer and fall of 1918 our tank program had been
augmented by the development of two entirely new types of tanks.
One was a two-man tank weighing 3 tons, built by the Ford Motor
Co. and costing in the neighborhood of $4,000. This tank, mounting
one machine gun, has a speed of about 8 miles an hour. Of this
type 15 had been built; and, up to the 1st of January, 1919, 500
were to have been finished, after which they were to have been
turned out by the Ford Co. at the rate of 100 a day.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>VIEW OF 35-TON TANK. SHOWING THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF WAR, PRESIDENT OF THE BALDWIN LOCOMOTIVE WORKS,
AND ARMY OFFICERS INSTRUMENTAL IN DESIGNING THIS MACHINE.</p>

<p>The tank has 400 horsepower, a speed of 6 miles an hour, and can climb a 45&deg; grade. It carries a crew of 11 men and is equipped with two 6-pounders
and seven machine guns.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>The other new tank developed was a successor to the French Renault,
designed for production in great volume. This tank was
to carry three men, instead of two, as the original Renault machine,
and mount two guns, one a machine gun and the other a 37-millimeter
gun. Some Renault tanks were equipped with 37-millimeter
cannon instead of machine guns. Cost of production of this machine
would have been very much less than that of the original Renault,
while the weight of the machine would have been substantially the
same and its fighting power much greater.</p>

<p>An outlay of about $175,000,000 was projected in the tank program,
but this, of course, was greatly reduced upon the signing of
the armistice. This outlay would have included, besides the cost
of the machines, expenses at various plants for increased facilities
for operation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

MACHINE GUNS.</h3>


<p>The machine gun is typically and historically an American device.
An American invented the first real machine gun ever produced.
Another American, who had taken British citizenship, produced
the first weapon of this type that could be called a success in war.
Still a third American gave to the allies at the beginning of the
great war a machine gun which revolutionized the world's conception
of what that weapon might be; while a fourth American inventor,
backed by our Ordnance Department, enabled the American forces
to take into the field in France what is probably the most efficient
machine gun ever put into action.</p>

<p>The machine gun as an idea is not modern at all. The thought
has been engaging the attention of inventors for several centuries.
The idea was inherent in guns which existed in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, but they should be called rapid-fire guns rather
than machine guns, since no machine principle entered into their
construction. They usually consisted of several gun barrels bound
together and fired simultaneously.</p>

<p>The first true machine gun was the invention of Richard Jordon
Gatling, an American, who in 1861 brought out what might be termed
a revolving rifle. The barrels, from 4 to 10 in number, were placed
parallel to each other and arranged on a common axis about which
they revolved in such a manner that each barrel was brought in
succession into the firing position. This gun was used to some
extent in our Civil War and later in the Franco-Prussian War.</p>

<p>In 1866 Reffye, a French inventor, brought out the first mitrailleuse&mdash;a
mounted machine gun of the Gatling type towing a limber
and drawn by four horses. It had 25 rifled barrels and could fire
125 shots per minute. The weapon, however, during the Franco-Prussian
War, turned out to be a failure for the reason that it proved
an excellent target for the enemy's artillery and was not sufficiently
mobile. Accordingly the French government abandoned it.</p>

<p>Sir Hiram S. Maxim, who was American born, in 1884 developed
a machine gun which operated automatically by utilizing the force
of the recoil. This gun was perfected and became a serviceable
weapon for the British army in the Boer War. The Maxim gun
barrel was cooled by the water-jacket system. When the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
became hot it exhausted a jet of steam which could be seen for long
distances across the South African veldt, making it a mark for the
Boer sharpshooters. This defect was remedied in homemade fashion
by carrying the exhaust steam through a hose into a bucket of water
where it was condensed. This Maxim gun fired 500 shots a minute.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in this country the Gatling gun had been so improved
that it became one of our standard weapons in the Spanish-American
War. Later on it was used in the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>The Colt machine gun also existed in 1898. This was the invention
of John M. Browning, whose name has been prominently associated
with the development of automatic firearms for the last
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>In England the Maxim gun was taken up by the Vickers Co.,
eventually becoming what is known to-day as the Vickers gun. In
1903 or 1904 the American Government bought some Maxim machine
guns which were then being manufactured by the Colt Co. at Hartford,
Conn.</p>

<p>In no war previous to the one concluded in 1918 did the machine
gun take a prominent place in the armaments of contending
forces. The popularity of the earlier machine guns was retarded
by their great weight. Some of them were so heavy that it took
several men to lift them. All through the history of the development
of machine guns the tendency has been toward lighter
weapons, but it was not until the great war that serviceable
machine guns were made light enough to give them great effectiveness
and popularity. Such intense heat is developed by the rapid
fire of a machine gun that unless the barrel can be kept cool the gun
will soon refuse to function. The water jacket which keeps the gun
cool proved to be the principal handicap to the inventors who were
trying to remove weight from the device. The earliest air-cooled
guns were generally unsuccessful, since the firing of a few rounds
would make the barrel so hot that the cartridges would explode
voluntarily in the chamber, thus rendering the weapon unsafe.
The Ben&eacute;t-Merci&eacute; partly overcame this difficulty by having interchangeable
barrels. As soon as one barrel became hot it could be
quickly removed and its cool alternate inserted in its place.</p>

<p>These conditions led to the development of machine guns along
two separate lines&mdash;the heavy type machine gun, which must be
capable of long sustained fire, and the automatic rifle, whose primary
requisite is extreme lightness. These requirements brought the ultimate
elimination from ground use in France and in the United States
of guns of the so-called intermediate weight as being incapable of fulfilling
either of the above requirements to the fullest degree.</p>

<p>The machine gun produced by the American inventor, Col. I. N.
Lewis, was a revelation when it came to the aid of the allies early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the great war. This was an air-cooled gun which could be fired
for a considerable time without excessive heating, and it weighed
only 25 pounds, no great burden for a soldier. The Lewis machine
gun was hailed by many as the greatest invention brought into
prominence by the war, although its weight put it in the intermediate
class, with limitations as noted above.</p>

<p>Along in the first decade of the present century the Ben&eacute;t-Merci&eacute;
automatic machine rifle was developed. This was an air-cooled gun
of the automatic rifle type and weighed 30 pounds. Light as this
gun was, it was still too heavy to be of great service as an automatic
rifle, since a strong man would soon tire of holding 30 pounds up to
his shoulder, and it was therefore in the intermediate class.</p>

<p>The Germans had apparently realized better than anyone else the
value of machine guns in the kind of fighting which they expected
to be engaged in, and therefore supplied them to their troops in
greater numbers than did the other powers, having, an early report
stated, 50,000 Maxim machine guns at the commencement of hostilities.
The Austrian Army had adopted an excellent heavy type
machine gun known as the Schwarzlose whose chief feature lay in the
fact that it operated with only one major spring.</p>

<p>Such was the machine-gun situation, although incompletely set
forth here, at the beginning of the great war. The nations, with the
exception of Germany, had been slow to promote machine gunnery
as a conspicuous phase of their military preparedness. In our Army
we had a provisional machine-gun organization, but no special officers
and few enthusiasts for machine guns. We were content
with a theoretical equipment of four machine guns per regiment.
The fact was that in no previous war had the machine gun demonstrated
its tactical value. The chief utility of the weapon was supposed
to lie in its police effectiveness in putting down mobs and civil
disorders and in its value in other special situations, particularly
defensive ones.</p>

<p>The three years of fighting in Europe before the United States was
drawn in had demonstrated the highly important place which the
machine gun held in modern tactics. Because of the danger of our
position we had investigated many phases of armed preparedness,
and in this investigation numerous questions had arisen regarding
machine guns. The Secretary of War had appointed a board of five
Army officers and two civilians to study the machine-gun subject,
to recommend the types of guns to be adopted, the number of guns
we should have per unit of troops, how these guns should be transported,
and other matters pertaining to the subject. Six months
before we declared war this board submitted a report strongly recommending
the previously adopted Vickers machine gun and the immediate
procurement of 4,600 of them. In December, 1916, the War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Department acted on this report by contracting for 4,000 Vickers
machine guns from the Colt Co. in addition to 125 previously ordered.</p>

<p>The Vickers gun belongs to what is known as the heavy type of
machine gun. The board found that the tests it had witnessed did
not then warrant the adoption of a light-type machine gun, although
the Lewis gun of the intermediate type was then being manufactured
in this country. The board, however, recommended that we
conduct further competitive tests of machine guns at the Springfield
Armory, in Massachusetts, these tests to begin May 1, 1917, the
interval being given to permit inventors and manufacturers to prepare
equipment for the competition.</p>

<p>The war came to us before these tests were made. On the 6th day
of April, 1917, our equipment included 670 Ben&eacute;t-Merci&eacute; machine
rifles, 282 Maxim machine guns of the 1904 model, 353 Lewis machine
guns, and 148 Colt machine guns. The Lewis guns, however,
were chambered for the .303 British ammunition and would not take
our service cartridges.</p>

<p>Moreover, the manufacturing facilities for machine guns in this
country were much more limited in extent than the public had any
notion of then or to-day. Both England and France had depended
mainly upon their own manufacturing facilities for their machine
guns, the weapons which they secured on order from the United
States being supplementary and subsidiary to their own supplies.
We had at the outbreak of the war only two factories in the United
States which were actually producing machine guns in any quantity
at all. These were the Savage Arms Corporation, which in its factory
at Utica, N. Y., was nearing the completion of an order for about
12,500 Lewis guns for the British and Canadian Governments, and the
Marlin-Rockwell Corporation, which had manufactured a large number
of Colt machine guns of the old lever type for the Russian Government.
The Colt factory in the spring of 1917 was equipping
itself with machinery to produce the 4,125 Vickers guns, the order for
4,000 of which had been placed the previous December by the War
Department on recommendation of the Machine Gun Board. None
of these guns, however, had been completed when the United
States entered the war. The Colt Co. also held a contract for
Vickers guns to be produced for the Russian Government.</p>

<p>It was therefore evident that we should have to build up in the
United States almost a completely new capacity for the production
of machine guns. Nevertheless, we took advantage of what facilities
were at hand; and at once, in fact within a week after the declaration
of war, began placing orders for machine guns. The first of these
orders came on April 12, when we placed a contract with the Savage
Arms Corporation for 1,300 Lewis guns, which, as manufactured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that corporation, had by this time been overhauled in design and
much improved. This order was subsequently heavily increased.
On June 2 we placed an order with the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation
for 2,500 Colt guns, these weapons to be used in the training of our
machine-gun units.</p>

<p>In this connection the reader should bear continually in mind
that throughout the development of machine-gun manufacture we
utilized all existing facilities to the limit in addition to building up
new sources of supply. In other words, whenever concerns were
engaged in the manufacture of machine guns, whatever their make
or type, we did not stop the production of these types in these plants
and convert the establishments into factories for making other
weapons; but we had them continue in the manufacture in which
they were engaged, giving them orders which would enable them
to expand their facilities in their particular lines of production.
Then when it became necessary for us to find factories to build Browning
guns and some of the other weapons on which we specialized,
we found new capacity entirely for this additional production.</p>

<p>Since we sent to France the first American division of troops less
than three months after the declaration of war, they were necessarily
armed with the machine guns at hand, which in this case proved
to be the Ben&eacute;t-Merci&eacute; machine rifles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the development of machine guns in Europe had been
going on at a rapid rate. The standard guns in use by the French
Army were now the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun and the Chauchat
light automatic rifle, both effective weapons. Upon the arrival of
our first American division in France the French Government expressed
its willingness to arm this division with Hotchkiss and
Chauchat guns; and thereafter the French facilities proved to be
sufficient to equip our troops with these weapons until our own
manufacture came up to requirements.</p>

<p>The 1st of May, 1917, brought the tests recommended by the
investigation board, these tests continuing throughout the month.
To this competition were brought two newly developed weapons
produced by the inventive genius of that veteran of small-arms
manufacture, John M. Browning. Mr. Browning had been associated
with the Army's development of automatic weapons for so many
years that he was peculiarly fitted to produce a mechanism that
could adapt itself to the quantity production which our forthcoming
effort demanded. Both the Browning heavy machine gun and the
Browning light automatic rifle which were put through these tests
in May had been designed with the view of enormous production
quickly attained, so that their simplicity of design was one of their
chief merits. After the tests the board pronounced these weapons
the most effective guns of their type known to the members. The
Browning heavy gun with its water jacket filled weighs 36.75 pounds,
whereas the Browning automatic rifle weighs only 15.5 pounds.
These May tests also proved the Lewis machine gun to be highly
efficient. The board recommended the production of large numbers
of all three weapons; the two Brownings and the Lewis. The board
also approved the Vickers gun, which weighs 37.50 pounds, and we
accordingly continued it in manufacture.</p>

<p>The first act of the Ordnance Department after this report had
been received was to increase greatly the orders for Lewis machine
guns with the Savage Arms Corporation, and the second to make
preparation for an enormous manufacture of Browning machine guns
and Browning automatic rifles. Mr. Browning had developed these
weapons at the plant of the Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing
Co., of Hartford, Conn., which concern owned the exclusive rights to
both these weapons under the Browning patents. This company at
once began the development of manufacturing facilities for the production
of Browning guns. In July, 1917, orders for 10,000 Browning
machine guns and 12,000 Browning automatic rifles were placed
with the Colt Co. It should be remembered that the Colt Co.
was in the midst of preparations for the production of large numbers
of Vickers machine guns; and the Government required
that the Browning manufacture should be carried on without interference
with the existing contracts for Vickers guns. This requirement
necessitated an enormous expansion of the Colt plant to take
care of its growing contracts for Browning guns. The concern prepared
to make the Browning automatic rifle, the lighter gun, at a
new factory at Meriden, Conn.</p>

<p>In its arrangements with the Colt Co. the Government recognized
that its future demands for Browning guns would be far beyond the
capacity of this one concern to supply. Consequently, for a royalty
consideration, the Colt Co. surrendered for the duration of the war,
its exclusive rights to manufacture these weapons, this arrangement
being approved by the Council of National Defense. Mr.
Browning, the inventor of the guns, was also compensated by the
Government for weapons of his invention manufactured during the
war. In the arrangement the Government acquired the right to
manufacture during the period of the emergency all other inventions
that might be developed by Mr. Browning&mdash;an important consideration,
since at any time the inventor might add improvements to
the original designs or bring out accessories that would add to the
efficiency or effectiveness of the weapons.</p>

<p>It may also be added that throughout this period Mr. Browning's
efforts were constantly directed toward the perfection of these guns
and the development of new types of guns and accessories. His
services along these lines were of great value to the War Department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>When these necessary preliminary matters had been settled the
Ordnance Department made a survey of the manufacturing facilities
of the United States to determine what factories could best be set
to work to produce Browning guns and rifles, always with special care
that no existing war contracts, either for the allies or for the United
States, be disturbed.</p>

<p>By September this survey was complete, and also by this time we
had definite knowledge of the rate of enlargement of our military
forces and their requirements for machine guns. We were ready to
adopt the program of machine-gun construction that would keep
pace with our needs, no matter what numbers of troops we might
equip for battle. As a foundation for the machine-gun program, in
September, 1917, we placed the following orders: 15,000 water-cooled
Browning machine guns with the Remington Arms-Union
Metallic Cartridge Co., of Bridgeport, Conn.; 5,000 Browning aircraft
machine guns with the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation, of New Haven,
Conn.; and 20,000 Browning automatic rifles with the Marlin-Rockwell
Corporation. In this connection it should be explained that
the Browning aircraft gun is essentially the heavy Browning with
the water-jacket removed. It was practicable to use it thus
stripped, because in aircraft fighting a machine gun is not fired continuously,
but only at intervals, and then in short bursts of fire too
brief to heat a gun beyond the functioning point.</p>

<p>At the same time these orders were placed the Winchester Repeating
Arms Co., of New Haven, Conn., was instructed to begin its
preliminary work looking to the manufacture of Browning automatic
rifles; and less than a month later, in October, an order for 25,000
of these weapons was placed with this concern. Then followed in
December an additional order for 10,000 Browning aircraft guns to
be manufactured by the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation. A contract
for Browning aircraft guns was also given to the Remington Arms-Union
Metallic Cartridge Co.</p>

<p>Before the year ended the enormous task of providing the special
machinery for this practically new industry was well under way. The
Hopkins &amp; Allen factory, at Norwich, Conn., had been engaged upon a
contract for military rifles for the Belgian government. Before this
order was completed the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation took over the
Hopkins &amp; Allen plant and set it to producing parts for the light Browning
automatic rifles. Even this concern, however, could not produce
the parts in sufficient quantities for the Marlin-Rockwell order, and
the latter concern accordingly acquired the Mayo Radiator factory,
at New Haven, and equipped it with machine tools for the production
of Browning automatic-rifle parts. Such expansion was merely
typical of what went on in the other concerns engaged in our machine-gun
production. Immense quantities of new machinery had to
be built and set up in all these factories. But still the Ordnance
Department kept on expanding the machine-gun capacity. The
New England Westinghouse Co., of Springfield, Mass., in January,
1918, completed a contract for rifles for the Russian government and
was at once given an order for Browning water-cooled guns. For
reasons which will be explained later, the original order for Browning
aircraft guns, which had been placed with the Remington Arms Co.,
was later transferred to the New England Westinghouse Co. at their
Springfield plant.</p>

<p>As soon as our officers in France could make an adequate study of
our aircraft needs in machine guns, they discovered that in the three
years of war only one weapon had met the requirements of the allies
for a fixed machine gun that could be synchronized to fire through the
whirling blades of an airplane propeller. This was the Vickers gun,
which was already being manufactured in some quantity in our
country, and for which three months before we entered the war we
had given an order amounting to 4,000 weapons. On the other
hand, the fighting aircraft of Europe were also finding an increased
need for machine guns of the flexible type&mdash;that is, guns mounted
on universal pivots, and which could be aimed and fired in any
direction by the second man, or observer, in an airplane. The best
gun we had for this purpose was the Lewis machine gun.</p>

<p>For technical reasons that need not be explained here, the Vickers
gun was a difficult one to manufacture. The Colt Co., which was
producing these weapons, in spite of their long experience in
the manufacture of such arms and in spite of their utmost efforts,
had been unable to deliver the finished Vickers guns on time, either
to the Russian government or to this country. However, by expanding
the facilities of this factory to the utmost, by the month of May,
1918, the concern achieved a production of over 50 Vickers guns
per day. Doubtless, because of these same difficulties, neither the
British nor the French governments had been able to procure Vickers
guns as rapidly as they expanded the number of their fighting aircraft,
and consequently when we entered the war we received at
once a Macedonian cry from the allies to aid in equipping the allied
aircraft with weapons of the Vickers type. An arrangement was
readily reached in this matter. Our first troops in France needed
machine guns for use on the lines. Our own factories had not yet
begun the production of these weapons. Accordingly, in the fall of
1917, we arranged with the French high commissioner in this country
to transfer 1,000 of our Vickers guns to the French air service, receiving
in exchange French Hotchkiss machine guns for Gen. Pershing's
troops.</p>

<p>Now while the demands of the allied service had brought forth only
the Vickers machine gun as a satisfactorily synchronized weapon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
we, shortly after our entry into the war, had succeeded in developing
two additional types of machine guns which gave every promise of
being satisfactory for use as fixed synchronized guns on airplanes.
One of these, of course, was the heavy Browning gun, stripped of
its water jacket; but because this was a new weapon, requiring an
entirely new factory equipment for its production, the day when
Brownings would begin firing at the German battle planes was remote,
indeed, as time is reckoned in war.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our inventors had been improving a machine
gun known as the Marlin, which was, in fact, the old Colt machine
gun, Mr. Browning's original invention, but now of lighter construction
and with a piston firing action instead of a lever control. In
the face of considerable criticism at the time, we proposed to adapt
this weapon to our aircraft needs as a stop-gap until Brownings were
coming from the factory in satisfactory quantities. We took this
course because we were prepared to turn out quantities of the Marlin
guns in relatively quick time. As has been said, the Marlin resembled
the Colt. The Marlin-Rockwell Corporation was already tooled up
for a large production of Colt guns, and this machinery with slight
modifications could be used to produce the Marlin.</p>

<p>We decided upon this course shortly after the declaration of war,
and there followed a severe engineering and inventive task to develop
a high-speed hammer mechanism and a trigger motor which would
adapt the gun for use with the synchronizing mechanism. But
then occurred one of those surprising successes that sometimes bless
the efforts of harassed and hurried executives at their wits' end to
meet the demand of some great emergency. The improvements
added to the Marlin gun eventually transformed it in unforeseen
fashion into an aircraft weapon of such efficiency that not only our
own pilots but those of the French air forces as well were delighted
with the result.</p>

<p>When it was proposed to adapt the Marlin gun for synchronized
use on airplanes, the Ordnance Department detailed officers
to cooperate with the Marlin company in its efforts. For technical
reasons of design the original gun apparently had little
or no adaptability to such use. Many new models were built only
to be knocked to pieces after the failure of some feature to
perform properly the work for which it was designed. Nevertheless
the enthusiasm of the company for its project could not be
chilled, and it continued the development until the gun finally
became a triumph in gas-operated aircraft ordnance.</p>

<p>In the latter part of August we were using the Marlin gun at the
front, and cablegram after cablegram told us of the surprisingly
excellent performances of this weapon in actual service. It is
sufficient here to quote one of these messages from Gen. Pershing,
dated February 23, 1918:</p>

<p>The French government tested the Marlin guns and declared them
to be the equal of the Vickers. In order to meet the ever-increasing
demands of the Air Service for machine guns capable of synchronization,
the original order for 23,000 Marlin guns, placed in September,
1917, with the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation, was afterwards increased
to 38,000. Along in 1918 the French tried to procure
Marlins from this country, but by that time the Browning production
was reaching great proportions, and the equipment at the Marlin
plant was being altered to make Brownings.</p>

<p>The original order for Lewis guns, placed with the Savage Arms
Corporation, had contemplated their use by our troops in the line;
but when it became evident that the available manufacturing capacity
of the United States would be strained to the utmost to provide
enough guns for our airplanes, we diverted the large orders for Lewis
guns entirely to the Air Service. This action was confirmed by
cabled instructions from Gen. Pershing. For this flexible aircraft
work the weapon was admirably adapted.</p>

<p>To the machine-gun tests, May, 1917, the producers of the Lewis
gun brought an improved model, chambered for our own
standard .30-caliber cartridges, instead of for the British .303 ammunition,
with some 15 modifications in design in addition to those which had
been presented to us before, and some added improvements in construction
and in the metallurgical composition of its materials.
From our point of view, this new model Lewis was a greatly improved
weapon. The fact should be stated here that the Lewis gun, as so
successfully made for the British service by the Birmingham Small
Arms Co., had never been procurable by the United States, even in a
single sample for test.</p>

<p>The Lewis accordingly became the standard flexible gun for our
airplanes. The Savage Arms Corporation was able to expand its
facilities to fulfill every need of our Air Service for this type of weapon,
and therefore we made no effort to carry the manufacture of Lewis
guns into other plants. Before 1917 came to an end the Savage
company was delivering the first guns of its orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>During the difficulties on the Mexican border the United States
secured from the Savage Arms Co. several hundred Lewis guns made
to use British ammunition. In order to be sure that the guns would
be properly used, experts from the factory were sent out to instruct
the troops who were to receive the guns. Ordnance officers also
went out on this instruction work and established machine-gun
schools along the border. The troops did not find the guns entirely
satisfactory, in spite of expert instruction that they received from
men from the factory. The trouble with the guns at this time was
due to the fact that the company making them in the United States
had been engaged in the manufacture of machine guns for a short
time only and had run into several minor difficulties in the design
and manufacture, difficulties which caused considerable trouble in
operating the guns in the field, and which were subsequently corrected
in the 15 changes mentioned above. The machine-gun schools
which were established on the border taught not only the mechanism
of the Lewis gun, but also those of the other types of guns with which
the various troops were armed. The first thing that these schools
developed was the fact that much of the trouble which had been
encountered in machine guns was undoubtedly due to the fact
that our soldiers were unfamiliar with the operation of the weapons.
In fact, at that time we had few experts in the operation of any make
of machine guns.</p>

<p>Soon after the establishment of machine-gun schools on the border
it became apparent that the system of instruction devised by our
ordnance officers had gone a long way toward overcoming the difficulties
which the Army had encountered in the use of machine guns.
The advantage of these schools was so marked that on the outbreak
of the war with Germany the Ordnance Department established a
machine-gun school at Springfield Armory. The first class of this
school consisted of a large number of technical graduates from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other such schools.
These men were employed as civilians, and were taught the mechanism
of machine guns in a theoretical way in as thorough a manner as
could possibly be done, and were given an opportunity to fire the
guns and find out for themselves just what troubles were likely to
occur. Many of these men were afterwards commissioned as officers
in the Ordnance Department and were sent to the various cantonments
throughout the United States to establish schools of instruction
in the mechanism of the various machine guns.</p>

<p>After this class of civilians had been graduated from the Springfield
school, a number of training-camp candidates were instructed
and were afterwards commissioned. When the full success of this
school was realized, it was enlarged and expanded, and it instructed
not only civilians and training-camp candidates, but also officers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the Ordnance Department, who were trained as armament officers,
instructors, etc. Later the school was still further expanded to
include a large class of enlisted men for duty as armorers. In all,
over 500 officers were instructed at the Springfield school.</p>

<p>When the war with Germany ceased, the graduates of the Springfield
Armory machine gun school were found in almost every line of
endeavor connected with arms, ammunition, and kindred subjects.</p>

<p>Now, let us look at the first results of the early effort in machine-gun
production. Within a month after the first drafted troops
reached their cantonments we were able to ship 50 Colt guns from
the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation to each National Army camp,
these guns to be used exclusively for training our machine-gun units.
Before another 30 days passed we had added to the machine-gun
equipment of each camp 20 Lewis guns of the ground type, and 30
Chauchat automatic rifles which we bought from the French. (The
Lewis ground gun was almost identical with the aircraft type, except
that its barrel was surrounded by an aluminum heat radiator for
cooling, a device not needed on the guns of airplanes because of the
latter's shorter periods of fire.) Also, in the autumn of 1917 we were
able to issue to each National Guard camp a training equipment consisting
of 30 Colt machine guns, 30 Chauchat automatic rifles, and
some 50 to 70 Lewis ground guns.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1918 our machine-gun manufacture was well
under way. Such was the industrial situation at this time: the
Savage Arms Corporation was producing Lewis aircraft machine
guns of the flexible type; the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation was manufacturing
large quantities of Marlin aircraft machine guns of the synchronizing
type; the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. was
building Vickers machine guns of the heavy, mobile type; and a number
of great factories were tooling up at top speed for the immense
production of Browning guns of all types soon to begin. Meanwhile
we kept increasing our orders as rapidly as conditions warranted.</p>

<p>By May, 1918, the first 12 divisions of American troops had
reached France. They were all equipped with Hotchkiss heavy
machine guns and Chauchat automatic rifles&mdash;both kinds supplied
by the French government. During May and June, 11 American
divisions sailed, and the heavy machine-gun equipment of these
troops was American built, consisting of Vickers guns. For their
light machine guns these 11 divisions received the French Chauchat
rifles in France. After June, 1918, all American troops to sail were
supplied with a full equipment of Browning guns, both of the light
and heavy types. Part of these Brownings were issued to the troops
before they sailed, and the rest upon their arrival in France.</p>

<p>The Savage Arms Corporation built nearly 6,000 Lewis guns of the
ground type before diverting their manufacture to the aircraft type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
exclusively. On May 11, 1918, this concern had built 16,000 Lewis
guns for the American Government, of which more than 10,000 were
for use on airplanes. By the end of July the company had turned
out 16,000 aircraft Lewis guns, not to mention 6,000 of the same sort
which it had built and supplied to the American Navy. By the
end of September we had accepted over 25,000 Lewis aircraft guns.
On the date of the signing of the armistice approximately 32,000 of
these guns had been completed.</p>

<p>By the first of May, 1918, the Marlin-Rockwell Corporation had
turned out nearly 17,000 Marlin aircraft guns with the synchronizing
appliances. Thirty days later its total had reached 23,000. On
October 1 the entire order of 38,000 Marlin guns had been completed,
and the company began the work of converting its plant
into a Browning factory.</p>

<p>On May 1, 1918, the Colt Co. had delivered more than 2,000
Vickers guns of the ground type. Before the end of July this output
totaled 8,000, besides 3,000 Vickers guns which were later converted
to aircraft use. In addition the Colt Co. had undertaken
another machine-gun project of which nothing has been said before.
This concern had completed manufacture of about 1,000 Vickers
guns for the Russian government. At this time the aviators at the
front began using machine guns of large caliber, principally against
observation balloons and dirigible aircraft. The allies had developed
an 11-millimeter Vickers machine gun for this purpose, which means
a gun with a bore diameter of nearly one-half inch. The Ordnance
Department undertook to change these Russian Vickers guns into 11-millimeter
aircraft machine guns. This undertaking was successfully
carried through by the Colt Co., which delivered the first modified
weapon in July and had increased its deliveries to a total of 800
guns by November 11, 1918.</p>

<p>When the fighting ceased the Colt Co. had delivered 12,000 heavy
Vickers guns and nearly 1,000 of the aircraft type. As was mentioned
before, a considerable quantity of Vickers ground guns had been
subsequently converted to aircraft use. The production of ground-type
Vickers ceased on September 12, 1918, by which date the
manufacture of Browning guns had developed sufficiently to meet
all of our future needs. Thereafter the Colt plant produced the aircraft
types of Vickers guns only. We shipped 6,309 Vickers ground
guns overseas before the armistice was signed, besides equipping six
France-bound divisions of troops with these weapons in this country,
making a total of 7,653 American-built Vickers in the hands of the
American Expeditionary Forces. Later, we planned to replace these
weapons with Brownings, turning over the Vickers guns to the Air
Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>But America's greatest feat in machine-gun production was the
development of the Browning weapons. These guns, as has been
noted, were of three types: the heavy Browning water-cooled gun,
weighing 37 pounds, for the use of our troops in the field; the light
Browning automatic rifle, weighing 15.5 pounds, and in appearance
similar to the ordinary service rifle, also for the use of our soldiers
fighting on the ground; and, finally, the Browning synchronized aircraft
gun of the rigid type, which was the Browning heavy machine
gun made lighter by the elimination of its water-jacket, speeded up
to double the rate of fire, and provided with the additional attachment
of the synchronized firing mechanism. Let us take up separately
the expansion of the facilities for manufacturing these types.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Colt Co., which owned the Browning rights,
in September, 1917, turned over to the Winchester Repeating Arms
Co. the task of developing the drawings and gauges for the manufacture
of Browning automatic rifles on a large scale. The latter
concern did a splendid job in this work. Early in March, 1918, the
Winchester Co. had tooled up its plant and turned out the first
Browning rifles. These were shipped to Washington and demonstrated
in the hands of gunners before a distinguished audience of
officers and other Government officials, and their great success assured
the country that America had an automatic rifle worthy of her
inventive and manufacturing prestige. By the first of May the
Winchester Co. had turned out 1,200 Browning rifles.</p>

<p>The Marlin-Rockwell Corporation attained its first production of
Browning rifles in June, 1918, by which time the Winchester Co.
had built about 4,000 of them. Before the end of June the Colt Co.
added its first few hundreds of Browning rifles to the expanding
output. By the end of July the total production of Browning rifles
had reached 17,000, produced as follows: 9,700 by Winchester; 5,650
by Marlin-Rockwell; and 1,650 by Colt's. Two months later this
total had been doubled&mdash;the exact figure being 34,500 Browning
rifles&mdash;and on November 11, 1918, when the flag fell on this industrial
race, the Government had accepted 52,238 light Browning
rifles. Of these in round numbers the Winchester Co. had built
27,000; Marlin-Rockwell, 16,000; and Colt's, 9,000.</p>

<p>But these figures give only an indication of the Browning
rifle program as it had expanded up to the time hostilities ceased.
When the armistice was signed our orders for these guns called for
a production of 288,174, and still further large orders were about to
be placed. As an illustration of the size which this manufacture
would have attained, we had completed negotiations with one
concern whereby its factory capacity was to be increased to produce
800 Browning rifles every 24 hours by June of 1919. After the armi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>stice
was signed we canceled orders calling for the manufacture of
186,000 Browning automatic rifles.</p>

<p>Of the 48,082 of these weapons sent overseas, 38,860 went in bulk
on supply transports, while the rest constituted the equipment of
12 Yankee divisions which carried their automatic rifles with them.</p>

<p>The Colt Co. itself developed the drawings and gauges for the
quantity manufacture of the Browning gun of the ground type. It
will be remembered that the New England Westinghouse Co. was the
first outside concern to begin the manufacture of these weapons.
The New England Westinghouse Co. received its orders in January,
1918, and within four months had turned out its first completed
guns, being the first company to deliver these weapons to the Government.
By the first of May it had delivered 85 heavy Brownings.</p>

<p>By the middle of May the Remington Co. came into production of
the heavy Brownings. The Colt Co., which was required to continue
its production of Vickers guns, was also retarded by the duty of
preparing the drawings for the other concerns who had contracted
to make heavy Brownings; and this factory, the birthplace of the
Browning gun, was not able to produce any until the end of June.
By this time the Westinghouse Co. had turned out more than 2,500
heavy Brownings, and Remington over 1,600.</p>

<p>By the end of July the production of Browning machine guns at
all plants had reached the total of 10,000; and two months later
26,000 heavy Brownings were in the hands of the Government. In
the following six weeks this production was enormously increased,
the total receipts by the Government up to November 11 amounting
to about 42,000 heavy Browning guns. In round numbers
Westinghouse produced 30,000 of these, Remington 11,000, and
Colt about 1,000.</p>

<p>We shipped in all 30,582 heavy Brownings to the American Expeditionary
Forces, 27,894 going on supply ships and the rest in the
hands of 12 divisions of troops.</p>

<p>These shipments actually put in France before the armistice was
signed enough heavy Brownings to equip completely all the American
troops on French soil. However, at the time these supplies were
arriving the fighting against the retreating German Army was at
its height, and there was no time for the troops on the line to exchange
their British-built and French-built machine guns for Brownings,
nor to replace their Chauchat automatic rifles with light Brownings,
of which there was also an ample supply in France.</p>

<p>A report of the Chief Ordnance Officer, American Expeditionary
Forces, as of February 15, 1919, shows that, except for antiaircraft
use, Vickers and Hotchkiss machine guns with troops had been almost
entirely replaced by heavy Brownings on that date, and that Chauchat
automatic rifles had been replaced by light Brownings.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed we had placed orders for 110,000
heavy Brownings and were contemplating still further orders. We
later reduced these orders by 37,500 guns.</p>

<p>Because the Marlin aircraft gun had performed so satisfactorily,
and because our facilities for the manufacture of this weapon were
large, the production of the Browning aircraft guns had not been
pushed to the limit, which latter action would have interfered with
the production of the Marlin gun at a time when it was most essential
to obtain an immediate supply of fixed synchronized aircraft
guns. Only a few hundred Browning aircraft guns had been completed
before the close of the fighting. In its tests and performances
this weapon had been speeded up to a rate of fire of from 1,000 to
1,300 shots per minute, which far surpassed the performances of
any synchronized gun then in use on the western front.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1918 it became evident that we would require a
special machine gun for use in our tanks. Several makes of guns
were considered for this purpose and finally discarded for one reason
or another. The ultimate decision was to take 7,250 Marlin aircraft
guns which were available and adapt them to tank service by the
addition of sights, aluminum heat radiators, and handle grips and
triggers. The rebuilding of these guns at the Marlin-Rockwell plant
when the armistice was signed was progressing at a rate that insured
the adequate equipment of the first American-built tanks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Ordnance Department undertook the production
of a Browning tank machine gun. This gun was developed by taking
a heavy Browning water-cooled gun, eliminating the water jacket
and substituting an air-cooled barrel of heavy construction, and
adding hand grips and sights. The work was begun in September,
1918, and the completed model was delivered by the end of
October. Before the armistice was signed five sample guns had been
built, demonstrated at the Tank Corps training camps, and unanimously
approved by the officers of the Tank Corps designated to
test it. After a test in France, the report stated: "The gun is by
far the best weapon for tank use that is now known, and the
Department is to be congratulated upon its development." An
order for 40,000 Browning tank guns was given to the Westinghouse
Co. This concern, already equipped for the manufacture of
heavy Browning guns, was scheduled to start its deliveries in December,
1918, and to turn out 7,000 tank guns per month after January 1,
1919. After the signing of the armistice, however, the order was
cut down to approximately 1,800 guns. By March 27, 1919, the
company had delivered 500 Browning tank guns, and the order for
the remaining 1,300 was thereafter canceled.</p>

<p>After the entrance of the United States in the war the armies on
both sides developed a new type of machine-gun fighting, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
consisted in indirect firing, or laying down barrages of machine-gun
bullets. This required the development of special tripods, clinometers
for laying angles of elevation, and other special equipment;
and speedy progress was being made in the quantity production of
this mat&eacute;riel when the war came to an end.</p>

<p>In a complete machine-gun program not only must the guns
themselves be built, but they must be fully equipped with accessories,
such as tripods, extra magazines, carts for carrying both guns and
ammunition, feed belts of various types, belt-loading machines,
observation and fire control instruments, and numerous other accessories
the manufacture of which is absolutely essential but usually
unseen by the public. The extent of our work in accessories is
indicated by a few approximate figures of deliveries up to the signing
of the armistice: nonexpendable ammunition boxes, 1,000,000;
expendable ammunition boxes, 7,000; expendable belts, 5,000; nonexpendable
belts, 1,000,000; belt-loading machines, 25,000; water
boxes, 110,000; machine-gun carts, 17,000; ammunition carts, 15,000;
tripods, 25,000.</p>

<p>The aircraft machine guns also required numerous accessories, some
of them highly complicated in their manufacture. This special
equipment consisted in part of special mounts for the guns, synchronizing
attachments, metallic disintegrating link belts, electric heaters
to keep the guns warm at the low temperatures at the high altitudes
of the aviator's battle field, and many other smaller items.</p>

<p>Not only our own forces but the allied armies as well were enthusiastic
about the Browning guns of both types, as soon as they had seen
them in action. The best proof of this is that in the summer of 1918
the British, Belgian, and French Governments all made advances to
us as to the possibility of the United States producing Browning automatic
rifles for their respective forces. On November 6, a few days
before the end of hostilities, the French high commissioner requested
that we supply 15,000 light Browning rifles to the French Army.
We would not make this arrangement at the time because we thought
it inadvisable to divert any of our supplies of these guns from our own
troops until the spring of 1919, when we expected that our capacity
for making light Brownings would exceed the demands of our own
troops. Our demand for the lighter guns, incidentally, was far
greater than we had originally expected it to be. As soon as the
Browning rifle was seen in action the General Staff of our Expeditionary
Forces at once increased by 50 per cent the number of automatic
rifles assigned to each company of troops, and we were manufacturing
to meet this augmented demand when the war ended. By
spring of 1919 we expected to be furnishing light Brownings to the
British and French Armies as well as to our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Both types of Browning guns proved to be unqualified successes
in actual battle, as numerous reports of our Ordnance officers overseas
indicated. The following report from an officer, in addition to carrying
historical information of interest to those following our machine-gun
development, is typical of numerous other official descriptions
of these weapons in battle use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The guns [heavy Brownings] went into the front line for the first time in the night
of September 13. The sector was quiet and the guns were practically not used at all
until the advance, starting September 26. In the action which followed, the guns
were used on several occasions for overhead fire, one company firing 10,000 rounds
per gun into a wood in which there were enemy machine-gun nests, at a range of 2,000
meters. Although the conditions were extremely unfavorable for machine guns on
account of rain and mud, the guns performed well. Machine-gun officers reported
that during the engagement the guns came up to the fullest expectations and, even
though covered with rust and using muddy ammunition, they functioned whenever
called upon to do so.</p>

<p>After the division had been relieved, 17 guns from one company were sent in for
my inspection. One of these had been struck by shrapnel, which punctured the
water jacket. All of the guns were completely coated with mud and rust on the
outside, but the mechanism was fairly clean. Without touching them or cleaning
them in any way, except to run a rod through the bore, a belt of 250 rounds was fired
from each without a single stoppage of any kind.</p>

<p>It can be concluded from the try-out in this division that the gun in its operation
and functioning when handled by men in the field is a success.</p></div>

<p>The Browning automatic rifles were also highly praised by our
officers who had to use them. Although these guns received hard
usage, being on the front for days at a time in the rain and when the
gunners had little opportunity to clean them, they invariably functioned
well.</p>

<p>On November 11 we had built 52,238 Browning automatic rifles in
this country. We had bought 29,000 Chauchats from the French.
Without providing replacement guns or reserves, this was a sufficient
number to equip over 100 divisions with 768 guns to the division.
This meant light machine guns enough for a field army of 3,500,000
men. In heavy machine guns at the signing of the armistice we had
3,340 of the Hotchkiss make, 9,237 Vickers, and 41,804 Brownings,
or a total of 54,627 heavy machine guns&mdash;enough to equip the 200
divisions of an army of 7,000,000 men, not figuring in reserve weapons.</p>

<p>The daily maximum production of Browning rifles reached 706
before our manufacturing efforts were suddenly stopped, and that of
Browning heavy machine guns 575. At the peak of our production
a total of 1,794 machine guns and automatic rifles of all types was
produced within a period of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Based upon our output in July, August, and September, 1918, we
were producing monthly 27,270 machine guns and machine rifles of
all types, while the average monthly production of France was at
this time 12,126 and that of Great Britain 10,947.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>In total production between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918,
we had turned out 181,662 machine guns and machine rifles, as against
229,238 by France and 181,404 by England in that same period.</p>

<p>One of the important features which contributed to the success of
the machine-gun program was the cordial spirit of cooperation which
the War Department met from the machine-gun manufacturers.
Competitive commercial advantages weighed not at all against the
national need, and the Department found itself possessed of a group
of enthusiastic and loyal partners with whom it could attack the vast
problem of machine-gun supply. Without these partners and this
spirit, the problem could not have been solved. The United States,
starting almost from the zero point, developed in little more than a
year a machine-gun production greater than that of any other country
in the world, although some of those countries had been fighting
a desperate war for three years and building machine guns to the limit
of their capacity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

SERVICE RIFLES.</h3>


<p>Although in the 19 months of American belligerency in the great
war we had sent to France upward of two million soldiers, each
rifleman among them as he stepped aboard his transport carried his
own gun. This weapon, which was to be his comrade and best
friend in the perilous months to come, was an American rifle, a rifle at
least the equal of any in use by soldiers of other nations, a rifle manufactured
in an American plant. It may have been one of the
dependable Springfield rifles. More likely, it was a modified 1917
Enfield, built from a design British in fundamental character, but
modified for greater efficiency by American ordnance officers after
the actual entry of the United States in the great struggle.
When it is considered that even a nation of such military genius as
France, especially skilled as she was in the construction of military
weapons, was three years developing her full ordnance program,
even though working at top speed, the rifle production of the United
States stands out as one of the feats of the war.</p>

<p>The story of the modified 1917 Enfield, which was the rifle on which
the American Expeditionary Forces based their chief dependence,
is an inspiring chapter in our munitions history. To get this weapon
we temporarily forsook the most accurate Army rifle the world had
ever seen and straightway produced in great quantities another one,
a new model, that proved itself to be almost, if not quite, as serviceable
for the kind of warfare in which we were to engage. It is the story
of triumph over difficulties, of American productive genius at its
best.</p>

<p>America, since the days of Daniel Boone a nation of crack shots,
was naturally the home of good rifles. Hence, perhaps, it is not
surprising that the United States should be the nation to produce
the closest shooting military rifle known in its day. This was the
United States rifle, model of 1903, popularly called the "Springfield."</p>

<p>The Springfield rifle had superseded in our Army the Krag, which
we had used in the Spanish-American War. In that conflict the
Spanish Army used a rifle of German design, the Mauser. Our
ordnance officers at that time considered the Krag to be a more
accurate weapon than the Mauser. Still we were not satisfied with
the Krag, and, after several years of development, in 1903 we brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
out the Springfield, the most accurate and quickest firing rifle that
had ever come from an arsenal.</p>

<p>There was no questioning the superiority of the Springfield in point
of accuracy. Time after time we pitted our Army shooting teams
against those of the other nations of the earth and won the international
competitions with the Springfield. We won the Olympic
shoot of 1908 over England, Canada, France, Sweden, Norway,
Greece, and Denmark. Again, in 1912, we won the Olympic shoot
against England, Sweden, South Africa, France, Norway, Greece,
Denmark, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. In 1912 the Springfield
rifle, in the hands of Yankee marksmen, won the Pan American
match at Buenos Aires, and in 1913 it defeated Argentina, Canada,
Sweden, and Peru. In all of these matches the Mauser rifle was
fired by various teams; but the Springfield never failed to defeat
this German weapon, which it was to meet later in the fighting of
the great war.</p>

<p>Altogether the Springfield rifle defeated the military rifles of 15
nations in shooting competitions prior to the war, and in 1912, at
Ottawa, an American team firing Springfields set marksmanship
records for 800 yards, 900 yards, and 1,000 yards that have never
been broken. Much is to be said for the men behind these guns, but
due credit must be given to the rifles that put the bullets where the
marksmen aimed.</p>

<p>Such was the history of this splendid arm when the United States
neared the brink of the great conflict. But as war became inevitable
for us and we began to have a realization of the scale on which we
must prosecute it, our ordnance officers studying the rifle problem
became persuaded that our Army could not hope to carry this
magnificent weapon to Europe as its chief small-arms reliance. A
brief examination of the industrial problem presented by the rifle
situation in 1917 should make it clear even to a man unacquainted
with machinery and manufacturing why it would be humanly impossible
to equip our troops with the rifle in developing which our
ordnance experts had spent so many years.</p>

<p>The Model 1903 rifle had been built in two factories and only two&mdash;the
Springfield Armory, Springfield, Mass., and the Rock Island
Arsenal at Rock Island, Ill. Our Government for several years
prior to 1917 had cut down its expenditures for the manufacture of
small arms and ammunition. The result was that the Rock Island
Arsenal had ceased its production of Springfields altogether, while
the output of rifles from the Springfield Armory had been greatly
reduced.</p>

<p>This meant that the skilled artisans once employed in the manufacture
of Springfield rifles had been scattered to the four winds.
When in early 1917 it became necessary to speed up the production
of rifles to the limit in these two establishments those in charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the undertaking found that they could recover only a few of the old,
trained employees. Yet even when we had restaffed these two
factories with skilled men their combined production at top speed
could not begin to supply the quantity of rifles which our impending
Army would need. Therefore, it was obviously necessary that we
procure rifles from private factories.</p>

<p>Why, then, was not the manufacture of Springfields extended to
the private plants? Some ante bellum effort, indeed, had been made
looking to the production of Springfields in commercial plants, but
lack of funds had prevented more than the outlining of the scheme.</p>

<p>Any high-powered rifle is an intricate production. The 1917
Enfield is relatively simple in construction, yet the soldier can dismount
his Enfield into 86 parts, and some of these parts are made up
of several component pieces. Many of these parts must be made with
great precision, gauged with microscopic nicety, and finished with unusual
accuracy. To produce Springfields on a grand scale in private
plants would imply the use of thousands of gauges, jigs, dies, and other
small tools necessary for such a manufacture, as well as that of great
quantities of special machines. None of this equipment for Springfield
rifle manufacture had been provided, yet all of it must be
supplied to the commercial plants before they could turn out rifles.</p>

<p>We should have had to spend preliminary months or even years in
building up an adequate manufacturing equipment for Springfields,
the while our boys in France were using what odds and ends of rifle
equipment the Government might be able to purchase for them,
except for a condition in our small-arms industry in early 1917 that
now seems to have been well-nigh providential.</p>

<p>Among others, both the British and the Russian Governments in
the emergency of 1914 and 1915 had turned to the United States to
supplement their sources of rifle supply while they, particularly the
British, were building up their home manufacturing capacity. There
were five American concerns engaged in the production of rifles on
these large foreign orders when we entered the war. Three of them
were the Winchester Repeating Arms Co., of New Haven, Conn.; the
Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Co., of Ilion, N. Y.; and
the Remington Arms Co. of Delaware at its enormous war-contract
factory at Eddystone, Pa., later a part of the Midvale Steel &amp; Ordnance
Co. These concerns had developed their manufacturing
facilities on a huge scale to turn out rifles for the British Government.
By the spring of 1917 England had built up her own manufacturing
facilities at home, and the last of her American contracts were nearing
completion.</p>

<p>Here, then, was at hand a huge capacity which, added to our
Government arsenals, could turn out every rifle the American Army
would require, regardless of how many troops we were to put in the
field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>But what of the gun that these plants were making&mdash;the British
Enfield rifle? As soon as war became a certainty for us the Ordnance
Department sent its best rifle experts to these private plants to study
the British Enfield in detail. They returned to headquarters without
enthusiasm for it; in fact, regarding it as a weapon not good enough
for an American soldier.</p>

<p>A glance at the history of the British Enfield will make clear some
of our objections to it. Until the advent of the 1903 Springfield, the
German Mauser had occupied the summit of military-rifle supremacy.
From 1903 until the advent of the great war these two rifles, the
Mauser and the Springfield, were easily the two leaders. The British
Army had been equipped with the Lee-Enfield for some years prior
to the outbreak of the great war, but the British ordnance authorities
had been making vigorous efforts to improve this weapon. The Enfield
was at a disadvantage principally in its ammunition. It fired
a .303-caliber cartridge with a rimmed head. From a ballistic standpoint
this cartridge was virtually obsolete.</p>

<p>In 1914 a new, improved Enfield, known as the Pattern '14, was
brought out in England, and the British Government was on the point
of adopting it when the great war broke out. This was to be a gun
of .276 caliber and was to shoot rimless, or cannelured, cartridges
similar to the standard United States ammunition. The war threw
the whole British improved Enfield project on the scrap heap.
England was no more equipped to build the improved Enfields than
we were to produce Springfields in our private plants. The British
arsenals and industrial plants and her ammunition factories were
equipped to turn out in the quantities demanded by the war only the
old "short Enfield" and its antiquated .303 rimmed cartridges.</p>

<p>Now England was obliged to turn to outside sources for an additional
rifle supply, and in the United States she found the three firms
named above willing to undertake large rifle contracts. Having to
build up factory equipment anew in the United States for this work,
England found that she might as well have the American plants
manufacture the improved Enfield as the older type. To produce
the 1914 Enfield without change in America and the older-type
Enfield in England would complicate the British rifle-ammunition
manufacture, since these rifles used cartridges of different sizes and
types. Accordingly, the British selected the improved Enfield for
the American manufacture, but modified it to receive the .303 rimmed
cartridges.</p>

<p>This was the gun, then, that we found being produced at New
Haven, Ilion, and Eddystone in the spring of 1917. The rifle had
many of the characteristics of the 1903 Springfield, but it was not
so good as the Springfield in its proportions, and its sights lacked
some of the refinements to which Americans were accustomed. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
even so it was a weapon obviously superior to either the French or
Russian rifle. The ammunition which it fired was out of the question
for us. Not only was it inferior, but, since we expected to continue
to build the Springfields at the Government arsenals, we should, if
we adopted the Enfield as it was, be forced to produce two sizes of
rifle ammunition, a condition leading to delay and unsatisfactory
output. The rifle had been designed originally for rimless ammunition
and later modified; so it could be modified readily back again
to shoot our standard .30-caliber Springfield cartridges.</p>

<p>It may be seen that the Ordnance Department had before it three
courses open, any one of which it might take. It could spend the
time to equip private plants to manufacture Springfields, in which
case the American rifle program would be hopelessly delayed. It
could get guns immediately by contracting for the production of
British .303 Enfields, in which case the American troops would carry
inferior rifles with them to France. Or, it could take a relatively
brief time, accept the criticism bound to come from any delay, however
brief such delay might be and however justified by the practical
conditions, and modify the Enfield to take our ammunition, in which
case the American troops would be adequately equipped with a good
weapon.</p>

<p>The decision to modify the Enfield was one of the great decisions
of the executive prosecution of the war&mdash;all honor to the men who
made it.</p>

<p>The three concerns which had been manufacturing the British
weapons conceded that it should be changed to take the American
ammunition. Each company sent to the Springfield Armory on
May 10, 1917, a model modified rifle to be tested. The test showed
the weapons still to be unsatisfactory, principally because they had
not been standardized. Standardization was regarded as an essential
for two reasons, one of them a matter of practical tactics in
the field and the other relating to production speed.</p>

<p>To begin with, the soldier on the battle field is his own rifle
repairman. His unit usually has on hand a supply of weapons
damaged or out of commission for one reason or another. If, therefore,
any part of the soldier's rifle is broken or damaged, he can go
to the stock of unused guns on hand and take from another rifle
the part which he requires; and it will fit his gun, provided there
has been standardization in the rifle manufacture at home. But
if the guns have not been standardized and each weapon is a filing
and tinkering job in the assembly room of the factory, then the
soldier in the field is not likely to be able to find a part that will
fit on his gun; and his rifle, if damaged, goes out of commission.
Or, if he finds a part which fits but does not fit perfectly, his gun
may break as he fires it, and he himself may suffer serious injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, standardization is essential to great speed
in production. If one plant producing rifles encounters a shortage
in any of the parts of the gun, it can send to another plant and
secure a supply of these parts, a favorable condition in manufacture
that is impossible if the weapon has not been standardized. The
value of standardization in speeding up manufacture, however, is
best shown in the actual records of rifle production during the war.
The fastest mechanic in any of the three Enfield factories before
1917 had set an assembly record of 50 rifles in one working day for
the British gun. After we had standardized the Enfield the high
assembly record was 280 rifles a day, while the assemblers in the
plants averaged 250 rifles a day per man when the work was well
started.</p>

<p>The Enfields sent to the Springfield Armory test were not standardized
at all, but were largely hand fitted. Little or no attempt
had been made to obtain interchangeability of parts among the
rifles turned out by the three plants. Even the bolt taken from
one company's rifle would not enter the receiver of another company's.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department was confronted with the dilemma of
approving and issuing a weapon pronounced unsuitable by its own
experts and thus obtaining speedy production, or of delaying until
interchangeability was established. It chose the latter course.</p>

<p>On July 12 a second set of rifles had been tested. These came
more nearly up to our ideas of standardization, but were still not
entirely satisfactory. Nevertheless we decided to go ahead with
production and improve the standardization as we went along.
The Winchester and Ilion plants elected to start work on that
understanding, but Eddystone preferred to wait for the final requirements.
Ilion afterwards decided to postpone production until the
final specifications were adopted. It would have been well if the
same course had been followed at the Winchester plant, for word
came later from Europe not to send over rifles of Winchester manufacture
of that period. The final drawings of the standardized and
modified Enfield did not come from the plants until August 18.
Six days later the thousands of dimensions had been carefully
checked and finally approved by the ordnance officers, and after
that production started off in earnest.</p>

<p>The wisdom of adopting the Enfield rifle and modifying it to
meet our requirements instead of extending the manufacture of
Springfields was almost immediately apparent, for in August, almost
as soon as the final drawings were approved, the first rifles were
delivered to the Government. This was possible because the modifications
which we adopted did not require any fundamental
changing of machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal equipment of these plants was in place and ready
to begin manufacturing Enfields at once; and while the changes in
the rifle were under discussion, the manufacturers were producing
their gauges and small tools as each modification was decided upon.</p>

<p>While we did not succeed in attaining, nor did we attempt to
attain, in fact, complete standardization and interchangeability of
the parts of the Enfields, we did all that was practicable in this
direction, several tests showing that the average of interchangeability
was about 95 per cent of the total parts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were building up the working staffs of the Rock
Island Arsenal and Springfield Armory and speeding the production
of Springfields. Before the war ended the Rock Island Arsenal,
which was making spare parts for Springfields, reached an output
equaling 1,000 completed rifles a day, while the Springfield Armory
attained a high average of 1,500 assembled rifles a day in addition
to spare parts equaling 100 completed rifles daily.</p>

<p>The Eddystone plant finished its British contracts on June 1,
Winchester produced its last British rifle on June 28, and Ilion on
July 21, 1917. Winchester delivered the first modified Enfields to us
on August 18, Eddystone on September 10, and Ilion about October 28.</p>

<p>The progress in the manufacture was thereafter steadily upward.
During the week ending February 2, 1918, the daily production of
military rifles in the United States was 9,247, of which 7,805 were
modified Enfields produced in the three private plants, and 1,442
were Springfields built in the two arsenals. The total production
for that week was 50,873 guns of both types, or nearly enough for
three Army divisions. In spite of the time that went into the standardization
of the Enfield rifle, all troops leaving the United States
were armed with American weapons at the ports of embarkation.</p>

<p>Ten months after we declared war against Germany we were producing
in a week four times as many rifles as Great Britain had
turned out in a similar period after 10 months of war, and our production
was then twice as large in volume as Great Britain had attained
in the war up to that time. By the middle of June, 1918, we
had passed the million and one-half mark in the production of rifles
of all sorts, this figure including over 250,000 rifles which had been
built upon original contracts placed by the former Russian government.</p>

<p>The production of Enfields and Springfields during the war up
to November 9, 1918, amounted to a total of 2,506,307 guns.
Of these 312,878 were Springfield rifles produced by the two Government
arsenals. We had started the war with a reserve of 600,000
Springfield rifles on hand, and in addition stored in our armories
and arsenals were 160,000 Krags. These latter had to be cleaned
and repaired in large part before they could be used. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Canadian Government we purchased 20,000 Ross rifles. The deliveries
of Russian rifles totaled 280,049. This gave us a total equipment
of 3,575,356 rifles. Since approximately one-half of the soldiers of
an army as actually organised carry rifles, the number of rifles procured
in all by the Ordnance Department was sufficient to arm both
for fighting and for training an army of 7,000,000 men, disregarding
reserve and maintenance rifles.</p>

<p>The Enfield thus became the dominant rifle of our military effort.
With its modified firing mechanism it could use the superior Springfield
cartridges with their great accuracy. The Enfield sights,
by having the peep sight close to the eye of the firer, gave even
greater quickness of aim than the Springfield sights afforded. In
this respect the weapon was far superior to the Mauser, which was the
main dependence of the German Army. All in all to a weapon that
made scant appeal to our ordnance officers in a few weeks we added
improvements and modifications that made the 1917 Enfield a gun
that for the short-range fighting in Europe compared favorably with
the Springfield and was to the allied cause a distinct contribution
which America substantially could claim to be her own.</p>

<p>Standardization not only made possible the ultimate speed with
which our rifles were produced but, together with the care of the
Government in purchasing raw materials and in drawing contracts, it
saved a great deal of money in the cost of these weapons. The
British had been paying approximately $42 apiece for Enfields produced
in the United States. The modified Enfields cost the Government
approximately $26 each. Thus in the total production of
2,202,429 modified Enfields, we saved $37,441,293 compared with
what this weapon had cost in the past.</p>

<p>Both the Springfield and the 1917 Enfield rifle possessed advantages
of accuracy and speed of fire over the German Mauser. It is
true that the Mauser fired a heavier bullet than that of our standard
ammunition and sent it with somewhat greater velocity; but at the
longer fighting ranges the Mauser bullet is not so accurate as the
United States bullet. Due to its peculiar shape, the Mauser bullet
is apt to tumble end over end at long ranges&mdash;"key-holing," the
marksmen call it&mdash;particularly when the wind blows across the
range. Such tumbling causes a bullet to curve as a baseball thrown
by a good pitcher, destroying its accuracy.</p>

<p>Early in our fighting with Germany we captured Mauser rifles and
hastened to compare them with the Springfields and modified
Enfields. We found in the American rifles a marked superiority
in the rapidity of fire, the quickness and ease of sighting, and in
the accuracy of shots fired. The accuracy was due not only to our
standard Springfield ammunition, but also to the greater mechanical
accuracy in the finish of the chamber and bore of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
rifles. The rapidity of fire of the American guns was due to the
position and shape of the bolt handle, which is the movable mechanism
on the rifle with which the soldier ejects a spent shell and throws
in a fresh one.</p>

<p>How we developed this bolt handle is an interesting story in itself.
In 1903, when we brought out the first Springfield rifle, we decided
to abandon the old carbine which had been carried by our Cavalry
regiments and, by making a rifle with a comparatively short barrel,
furnish a gun which could be used by both Infantry and Cavalry.
The original bolt handle of the Springfield, like the one on the present
Mauser, had projected horizontally from the side of the chamber.
It was found that this protuberance did not fit well in the saddle
holster of the cavalryman, but jammed the side of the rifle against
the leather of the holster, with frequent injury to the rifle sight.
For this primary reason the rifle designers bent the bolt handle
down and back. This modification incidentally brought the bolt
handle much nearer to the soldier's hand as he fingered the trigger
than it had been before. The Enfield design had carried this development
even farther, so that the bolt handle was practically right
at the trigger, and the rifleman's hand was ready to pull the trigger
the instant after it had thrown in a new cartridge.</p>

<p>Let us see what effect this design of the bolt handle had in the
recent war. The Mauser still clung to the old horizontal bolt
handle well away from the trigger grip. Some of our best riflemen
practiced with the captured Mausers and, firing at top speed with
them, could not bring the rate of shooting anywhere near up to
the marks set by the Enfields and Springfields. One enthusiast
has even maintained that the speed of the Mauser is not over 50
per cent of that of the 1917 American rifle, but this may be an
underestimate. On such a basis the result was that under battle conditions
with equal numbers of men on a side the Americans had in
effect two rifles to the Germans one.</p>

<p>To put it another way, by bending back the bolt handle we had
placed two men on the firing line where there was only one before;
but the added man required no shelter, nor any clothing, nor rations,
nor water, nor pay. Although he sometimes needed repairing, he
did not get sick, nor did he ever become an economic burden nor
draw a pension. His only added cost to the Government was an
increased consumption of cartridges.</p>

<p>When American troops were in the heat of the fighting in the summer
of 1918, the German government sent a protest through a neutral
agency to our Government asserting that our men were using
shotguns against German troops in the trenches. The allegation was
true; but our State Department replied that the use of such weapons
was not forbidden by the Geneva Convention as the Germans had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
asserted. Manufactured primarily for the purpose of arming guards
placed over German prisoners, these shotguns were undoubtedly in
some instances carried into the actual fighting. The Ordnance
Department procured some 30,000 to 40,000 shotguns of the short-barrel
or sawed-off type, ordering these from the regular commercial
manufacturers. The shell provided for these guns each contained a
charge of nine heavy buckshot, a combination likely to have murderous
effect in close fighting.</p>

<p>Such was the rifle record of this Government in the war. The
Americans carried into battle the best rifles used in the war, and
America's industry produced these weapons in the emergency at a
rate which armed our soldiers as rapidly as they could be trained for
fighting. Success in such a task looked almost impossible at the
start; but that it was attained should forever be a source of gratification
to the American people.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />

PISTOLS AND REVOLVERS.</h3>


<p>The American pistol was one of the great successes of the war. For
several years before the war came the Ordnance Department had been
collaborating with private manufacturers to develop the automatic
pistol; but none of our officers realized until the supreme test came
what an effective weapon the Colt .45 would be in the hand-to-hand
fighting of the trenches. In our isolation we had suspected, perhaps,
that the bayonet and such new weapons as the modern hand grenade
had encroached upon the field of the pistol and revolver. We were
soon to discover our mistake. In the hands of a determined American
soldier the pistol proved to be a weapon of great execution, and
it was properly feared by the German troops.</p>

<p>We had long been a nation of pistol shooters, we Americans, but
not until the year 1911 did we develop a pistol of the accuracy and
rapidity of fire demanded by our ordnance experts. The nations of
Europe had neglected this valuable arm almost altogether, regarding
it principally as a military ornament which only officers should
carry. The result of Europe's neglect was that the small-caliber
revolvers of the Germans and even of the French and English were
toys in comparison with the big Colts that armed the American
soldiers.</p>

<p>America owed the Colt .45 to the experiences of our fighters in the
Philippines, and to the inventive genius of John Browning of machine-gun
fame. In the earlier Philippine campaigns our troops used a .38-caliber
pistol. Our soldiers observed that when the tough tribesmen
were hit with these bullets and even seriously wounded they frequently
kept on fighting for some time. What was needed was a hand
weapon that would put the adversary out of fighting the instant he
was hit, whether fatally or not. We therefore increased the caliber
of the automatic pistol to .45 and slowed down the bullet so that
it tore flesh instead of making a clean perforation. These improvements
gave the missile the impact of a sledge hammer, and a man
hit went down every time.</p>

<p>Moreover, in this development great improvement had been made
in the accuracy of the weapon, the 1911 Colt being the straightest-shooting
pistol ever produced in this country. Even the best of the
older automatics and revolvers were accurate only in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
expert marksmen. But any average soldier with average training
can hit what he shoots at with a Colt. The improvements in the
automatic features brought it to the stage where it could be fired by
a practiced man 21 times in 12 seconds. In this operation the recoil
of each discharge ejects the empty shell and loads in a fresh one.</p>

<p>Only a few men of each infantry regiment carried pistols when our
troops first went into the trenches. But in almost the first skirmish
this weapon proved its superior usefulness in trench fighting. Such
incidents as that of the single American soldier who dispersed or
killed a whole squad of German bayoneteers which had surrounded
him struck the enemy with fear of Yankee prowess with the pistol.
The "tenderfoot's gun," as the westerners loved to call it, had come
to its own.</p>

<p>By midsummer of 1917 the decision had been made to supply to
the infantry a much more extensive equipment of automatic pistols
than had previously been prescribed by regulations&mdash;to build them
by hundreds of thousands where we had been turning them out by
thousands. In February, with war in sight, realizing the limitations
of our capacity then for producing pistols, the Colt automatic
being manufactured exclusively by the Colt's Patent Firearms
Manufacturing Co. at Hartford, Conn., and for a limited period
by the Springfield Armory, we took up with the Colt Co. the proposition
of securing drawings and other engineering data which would
enable us to extend the production of this weapon to other plants.
This work was in progress when in April, 1917, it was interrupted
by the military necessity for calling upon every energy we had in
the production of rifles.</p>

<p>In order to supplement the pistol supply, although the Colt automatic
was the only weapon of this sort approved for the Army, the
Secretary of War authorized the Chief of Ordnance to secure other
small arms, particularly the double-action .45-caliber revolver as
manufactured by both the Colt Co. and the Smith &amp; Wesson Co.
These revolvers had been designed to use the standard Army caliber-.45
pistol cartridges. The revolver was not so effective a weapon
as the automatic pistol, but it was adopted in the emergency only to
make it possible to provide sufficient of these arms for the troops at
the outset.</p>

<p>At the start of hostilities the Colt Co. indicated that it could tool
up to produce pistols at the rate of 6,000 per month by December,
1917, and could also furnish 600 revolvers a week beginning in April.
As soon as funds were available we let a contract to the Colt Co. for
500,000 pistols and 100,000 revolvers, and to the Smith &amp; Wesson
Co. one for 100,000 revolvers. Although these contracts were not
placed until June 15, in the certainty that funds would eventually
be available both concerns had been working on the production of
weapons on these expected contracts for many weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>When the order came from France to increase the pistol equipment,
in addition to efforts to increase production at the plants
of the two existing contractors we made studies of numerous other
concerns which might undertake this class of manufacture. The
proposal to purchase .38-caliber revolvers as a supplementary supply
was abandoned for the reason that any expansion of this manufacture
and of that for the necessary ammunition would be at the expense of
the ultimate output of .45s and ammunition therefor.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, the Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge
Co. was instructed to prepare for the manufacture of 150,000 automatics,
Colt model 1911, at a rate to reach a maximum production of
3,000 per day. Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining
the necessary drawings and designs, because the manufacture of
these pistols at the Colt Co. plant had been largely in the hands
of expert veteran mechanics, who knew tricks of fitting and assembling
not apparent in the drawings. The result was that the
drawings in existence were not completely representative of the
pistols. Finally complete plans were drawn up that covered all
details and gave interchangeability between the parts of pistols produced
by the Remington Co. and those by the Colt Co., which was
the goal sought.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1918 in order to fill the enormously increased
pistol requirements of the American Expeditionary Forces,
contracts for the Colt automatic were given to the National Cash
Register Co., at Dayton, Ohio; the North American Arms Co., Quebec;
the Savage Arms Co., Utica, N. Y.; Caron Bros., Montreal; the Burroughs
Adding Machine Co., Detroit, Mich.; the Winchester Repeating
Arms Co., New Haven, Conn.; the Lanston Monotype Co., Philadelphia,
Pa.; and the Savage Munitions Co., San Diego, Calif.</p>

<p>All of these concerns, none of which had ever before produced
the .45-caliber pistol, were proceeding energetically with their preparations
for manufacture when the armistice came to cancel their contracts.
No pistols were ever obtained from any except the Colt's
Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. and the Remington Arms-Union
Metallic Cartridge Co.</p>

<p>Difficulty was experienced in securing machinery to check the
walnut grip for the pistols, and to avoid delay in production the
Ordnance Department authorized the use of Bakelite for pistol grips
in all the new plants which were to manufacture the gun. Bakelite
is a substitute for hard rubber or amber, invented by the eminent
chemist Dr. Baekeland.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war the Army owned approximately
75,000 .45-caliber automatic pistols. At the signing of the armistice there
had been produced and accepted since April 6, 1917, a total of 643,755

<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />

SMALL-ARMS AMMUNITION.</h3>


<p>Prior to the war with Germany the Ordnance Department, in
providing .30-caliber ammunition for our Army rifles and machine guns,
had thought in terms of millions and had placed its ammunition orders
on that scale. But when hostilities were at hand and steel and
walnut were being assembled into rifles to arm the indefinitely increasing
millions of Yankee soldiers that we would send and keep on
sending to Europe until victory was ours, small-arms ammunition
stepped out of the million class and became an industry whose units
of production were reckoned by the billion.</p>

<p>The war increased the human strength of the American Army approximately
thirty times. That ratio of increase was carried over
into a production of ammunition for rifles and machine guns. The
story of ammunition in the war is the story of a three-billion output
forced from a hundred-million capacity. In this effort we find
another of those frequent industrial romances which the war produced
in America; for, when called upon to do more than an industrial
possibility, as we regarded such things in 1917, the contriving
executive and organizing ability and the skillful hands of the ammunition
industry made good.</p>

<p>Our .30-caliber ammunition capacity in the United States prior to
the war was about 100,000,000 cartridges per year. We actually
produced in the war period the huge total of 3,507,023,300 small-arms
cartridges. Pushed at feverish haste, such expansion naturally
recorded its mistakes and its failures; but none of these was fatal or
irremediable. The fact will always remain that a difficult art was
enlarged in time to take care of every demand of the American Army
for small-arms ammunition, and that no military operation on our
part was held up by lack of this ammunition. Hence it is submitted
that the production of small-arms cartridges was one of the genuine
achievements of our Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>Let us consider first the production of the .30-caliber service
ammunition, which may be regarded as the standard product of the
ammunition industry. This was the ammunition used in our two
service rifles, the Springfield or United States model of 1903 and the
United States model of 1917, which is a modification of the British
rifle, pattern 1914, and in most of the machine guns which we fired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
in France, although we used the 8-millimeter cartridge with the Chauchat
machine rifle. When the war broke out we had on hand approximately
200,000,000 rounds of .30-caliber cartridges. Most of these
had been manufactured by the Government at the Frankford Arsenal,
which was, in fact, practically the only plant in the United States
equipped to produce this ammunition in any appreciable quantities.</p>

<p>For some years prior to the war, however, the Government had
adopted the policy of encouraging the manufacture of Army ammunition
in private plants. This was done by placing with various concerns
small annual orders for this type of ammunition. These orders
were usually in the neighborhood of 1,000,000 rounds each. The
purpose of such orders, insignificant as they were, was to scatter
throughout the principal private ammunition factories the necessary
jigs, fixtures, gauges, and other tooling required in the production
of cartridges for Army rifles and machine guns. These small orders
might also be expected to educate the operating forces of the private
plants in this manufacture. By this means the Government hoped
to have in an emergency a nucleus of skill and equipment which could
be quickly expanded to meet war requirements.</p>

<p>As a further means of stimulating interest in this peace-time undertaking
the Ordnance Department conducted each year a sort of competition
among the private manufacturers of small-arms ammunition.
The output of each factory accepting the Government orders was
tested for proper functioning and accuracy; and those cartridges
which won in this competition were used as the ammunition shot in
the national rifle matches. Thus the winning concern could use its
achievement in its advertising.</p>

<p>But these educational efforts on the part of the Government failed
to create a capacity that was anywhere near to being adequate to
meet the demands of such a war as that into which we were plunged
in the year 1917. We had built up no large reserves of ammunition,
and the orders placed with private manufacturers had been so
small that they had resulted in virtually no factory preparation at
all for great quantity production. To all practical purposes the
entire ammunition manufacturing capacity of .30-caliber cartridges
in 1917 was encompassed within the walls of the Frankford Arsenal.</p>

<p>There was, however, in the ammunition industry a fortunate condition
existing when we entered the war. For some time numerous
American concerns had been working on the manufacture of cartridges
for both the British and the French Governments. The
cartridges being turned out under these contracts were not suitable
for our use, being of different caliber than those taken by American
weapons, and this meant that the machinery in existence could not
be converted to the production of American ammunition without
radical and time-consuming alteration of tools, etc. However, car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>tridges
are cartridges, regardless of their size; and the manufacture
which was supplying France and England had resulted in educating
thousands of mechanics and shop executives in the production of
ammunition. Consequently, when we went into the war, we had the
men and the skill ready at hand; we needed only to produce the
tools and the machinery in addition to the raw materials.</p>

<p>Yet this in itself was a problem. How should we meet it? Three
courses seemed to be possible for the Government. In the first
place, we could build from the ground up an immense Government
arsenal having an annual capacity of 1,000,000,000 rounds, or ten
times that of the great Frankford Arsenal. Or we could interest
manufacturers in a project of building a private cartridge factory
capable of producing 1,000,000,000 rounds per year. Both of these
methods were predicated on the assumption that the existing cartridge
factories had their hands full with orders. The third plan was
to place our cartridge demands with the existing ammunition plants
and let them increase their facilities to take care of our orders.</p>

<p>As soon as the early orders had been given and all available capacity
had been set going, this problem engaged the study and attention
of the Ordnance Department. In the early fall of 1917 a meeting
of the manufacturers of small-arms ammunition was held in Washington
to discuss the matter. Principally on account of the difficulties
in providing a trained working force for a new Government
arsenal or private plant, the opinion was unanimous that the existing
concerns should expand in facilities and trained personnel to handle
the cartridge project. Out of this meeting grew the American Society
of Manufacturers of Small Arms and Ammunition. Thereafter until
the close of the war this society or its committees met about once
every two weeks to discuss problems arising in the work. The
officers of the Ordnance Department in charge of the ammunition
project attended all of these meetings. The result of such cooperation
was gratifyingly shown not only in the standardization of manufacturing
processes in the various plants but also in the output of
cartridges.</p>

<p>The success of this effort is best shown in the production figures
in the period from April, 1917, to November 30, 1918. In that
time the United States Cartridge Co. turned out 684,334,300 rounds
of our caliber-.30 service ammunition; the Winchester Repeating
Arms Co., 468,967,500 rounds; the Remington Arms-Union Metallic
Cartridge Co., 1,218,979,300; the Peters Cartridge Co., 84,169,800;
the Western Cartridge Co., 48,018,800; the Dominion Arsenal,
502,000; the Frankford Arsenal, 76,739,300; and the National Brass
&amp; Copper Tube Co., 22,700,400.</p>

<p>This production record to some extent was made possible by a
leniency on the part of the Ordnance Department which we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
not displayed before the war. When we could take plenty of time
in ammunition manufacture our specifications for cartridges were
extremely rigid. It soon became apparent that if we adhered to
our earlier specifications we would limit the output of cartridges.
It was found in a joint meeting of ordnance officers and ammunition
manufacturers that certain increased tolerances could be permitted
in our specifications without affecting the serviceability of the
ammunition. Consequently new specifications for our war ammunition
were drawn, enabling the plants to get into quantity production
much more quickly than would have been possible if we had not relaxed
our prewar attitude.</p>

<p>The ordinary service cartridge consists of a brass cartridge case, a
primer, a propelling charge of smokeless powder, and a bullet made
with a jacket or envelope of cupronickel inclosing a lead slug or core.
Cupronickel is a hard alloy of copper and nickel. Steel would be the
ideal covering for a bullet because of its cheapness and availability,
but steel has not been used because it is liable to rust and to destroy
the delicate rifling of the gun barrel. Cupronickel is a compromise,
being strong enough to hold the interior lead from deforming, but
not so hard as to wear down excessively the rifling in the gun barrel.</p>

<p>Even as we entered the war the long continued fighting in Europe
had created a shortage in cupronickel, and by the time the armistice
came it was apparent that this shortage would soon become so acute
that we would have to find a substitute for cupronickel. This shortage
had already occurred in Germany, where the enemy ordnance
engineers had produced a bullet incased in steel which in turn was
clothed with a slight covering of copper. The soft copper coating
kept the steel from injuring the gun barrel. We ourselves were
experimenting with copper-coated steel bullets when peace came, and
would have been prepared to furnish a substitute had cupronickel
failed us.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest ammunition sent to our forces in France
developed a tendency to hang fire and to misfire; and a liberal quantity
of it, amounting to six months' production of the Frankford
Arsenal, was condemned and withdrawn from use. This matter was
aired fully in the newspapers at the time it occurred. It developed
that the faulty ammunition had been produced entirely in the Frankford
Arsenal and that the cause of the trouble was the primer in the
cartridge.</p>

<p>The primer in a cartridge performs the same function that the flint
did on the old-fashioned squirrel guns&mdash;it touches off the explosive
propellant charge. But whereas the flint sent only a spark into the
powder, the modern primer produces a long, hot flame.</p>

<p>The primers in the ammunition manufactured at the Frankford
Arsenal had given ordinarily satisfactory results in 12 years of peace-time
use. The flame charge in this primer contained sulphur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
potassium chlorate, and antimony sulphide. Produced under normal
conditions, with plenty of time for drying, this primer was satisfactory.
But sulphur when oxidized changes to an acid extremely corrosive
to metal parts, and oxidized primers are liable not to function
perfectly. Heat and moisture accelerate the change of sulphur to
acid; and if there happens to be bromate in the potassium chlorate
of the priming charge, the change is even more rapid.</p>

<p>An investigation of the Frankford Arsenal showed that these very
elements were present. Because of the haste of production of cartridges,
too much moisture had been allowed to get into the arsenal
dry houses. The potassium chlorate was also found to contain appreciable
quantities of bromate.</p>

<p>The condition was remedied by adopting another primer composition.
And then, to play doubly safe, the Government specifications
were amended to prevent the use of potassium chlorate containing
more than 0.01 per cent of bromate.</p>

<p>However, this condemned ammunition was but a trifling fraction of
the total output or even of the production then going on. The
primers used by the various private manufacturers of ammunition
functioned satisfactorily.</p>

<p>While we were not rigid in our specifications for the bulk of the
service ammunition, in one respect we were most meticulous, and this
was in respect to the ammunition used by the machine guns mounted
on our airplanes. For these weapons we created an A-1 class of
service .30-caliber cartridges, since it was highly important that there
be no malfunctioning of ammunition in the air. Every cartridge of
this class had to be specially gauged throughout its manufacture.
This care resulted in a slower production of airplane cartridges than
that of those for use on the ground, but we always had enough for
our needs.</p>

<p>Until we went to war with Germany our Army had known only
the cartridge firing the hard-jacketed lead bullet. But we entered
a conflict in which several novel sorts of small-arms projectiles were
in familiar use; and it became necessary for us to take up the manufacture
of these strange missiles at once. These included such special
types as tracer bullets to indicate the path of fire in the air,
incendiary bullets for setting on fire observation balloons, hostile
planes, and dirigible airships, and, finally, armor-piercing bullets for
use against armor plate with which airplanes and tanks are equipped.
We had developed none of these in this country before the war, except
that in the Frankford Arsenal our designers had done some
little experimental work with armor-piercing ammunition, in fact
carrying it to the point of an efficient design.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the Ordnance Department was to send an
officer to visit the ammunition factories of France and England to
study the methods of manufacturing these special types of bullets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
These friendly nations willingly gave us full information at first hand
with respect to this complicated manufacture, which we were thus
enabled to begin in September, 1917. Special machinery was
required for loading the tracer bullet and also for producing the
incendiary projectile. We adopted British practice for both of these.
We ourselves were well equipped to begin the production of armor-piercing
bullets, for which we had previously solved the problems
of design; yet the production of metals to be used in this missile
required some further experimental work. By February, 1918,
however, our production of armor-piercing bullets was well under
way and by the time the war came to an end we had produced
nearly 5,000,000 of them.</p>

<p>The tracer bullet which we manufactured contained a mixture of
barium peroxide and magnesium and in flight burned with the
intensity of a calcium light. These bullets were principally used by
machine gunners of aircraft, since in the air it is impossible to tell
where machine-gun projectiles are going unless there is some
device enabling the gunner to see the trajectory of the bullets.
This is done by inserting tracer bullets at intervals in the belts
of cartridges fed into the machine gun. The common conception
of a tracer bullet is one that leaves a trace of smoke in its flight;
whereas the truth is that our tracer and the British tracer were
practically smokeless, the gunner observing the direction of aim by
following the bright lights of the tracer bullets with his eye. These
lights were plainly visible in the brightest sunlight. Although the
slight quantity of the flaming mixture burned but a few seconds, it
was sufficient to trace the flight for 500 yards or more from the muzzle
of the machine gun.</p>

<p>The tracer bullet consisted of a cupronickel shell, the nose of
which contained a leaden core to balance the bullet properly. The
rear chamber of the bullet held a cup containing the mixture of barium
peroxide and magnesium. The rear end of the bullet was left
slightly open, and through this opening the mixture was ignited by
the hot flame of the propelling powder discharge.</p>

<p>An entirely different principle was used in the construction of the
incendiary bullet. This bullet was also incased in cupronickel;
but the incendiary chemical, which was phosphorus, was contained
in a chamber in the nose of the bullet. A serrated plug held the
phosphorus in its chamber, and behind this plug was a solid plug
of lead coming flush with the base of the bullet and soldered thereto.
On one side of the missile was a hole drilled through the cupronickel
into one of the grooves of the serrated plug. This hole was stopped
by a special kind of solder. The heat of friction developed in the
infinitesimal space of time while the projectile was passing through
the gun barrel served the double purpose of melting out the solder
from the hole and igniting the phosphorus within the chamber. Thereafter
the centrifugal force of the revolving bullet whirled the burning
phosphorus out through the unplugged hole. Seen in the air the fire
of the phosphorus could not be discerned, but the burning chemical
threw off considerable smoke, so that the eye of the gunner could
follow the blue spiral to its mark. Our incendiary bullet had an
effective range of 350 yards, after which distance the phosphorus was
burned out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally interesting was the construction of the armor-piercing
bullet. Heavy and solid as the jacketed lead bullet used in our service
guns seems to be, when fired against even light armor plate it
leaves only a small mark upon its objective. As soon as the cupronickel
jacket strikes the armor plate it splits and the lead core flattens
out and flies into fragments. The armor plate may not even be
dented by this impact. Yet change the core of this missile from lead
to hardened steel and an entirely different result is produced. Our
armor-piercing bullet was made with a cupronickel jacket for the
sake of the gun barrel. The inner side of this jacket was lined with
a thin coat of lead which was made thicker in the nose of the bullet.
Finally a core of specially heat-treated steel completed the construction
of the projectile. When this missile is fired against armor
plate the jacket splits and the lead lining virtually disappears from
the impact, but the pointed steel core keeps on and bores a hole
through the plate as it might through soft wood.</p>

<p>The production figures show the degree of success which we attained
in the manufacture of this special ammunition. Up to November 30,
1918, the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Co. had produced 6,057,000
tracer cartridges of .30 caliber and 1,560,000 incendiary cartridges
of the same size. The Frankford Arsenal turned out 22,245,000
tracer cartridges of this size, 14,148,000 incendiary cartridges, and
4,746,900 armor-piercing cartridges. We placed an additional order
for armor-piercing projectiles with the Dominion arsenals, which
delivered to us 1,980,000 of such cartridges.</p>

<p>We also set out to develop new manufacturing facilities for the
production of this special aircraft ammunition. Excellent tracer
bullets were produced by the National Fireworks Co., of West
Hanover, Mass., and that company was getting into a satisfactory
production stride when the armistice was signed. The Hero Manufacturing
Co., of Philadelphia, Pa., also was turning out an approved
incendiary bullet when peace came. These various special bullets
were loaded in cartridges at the Frankford Arsenal.</p>

<p>When the fighting ceased we were working on the development of
armor-piercing bullets that would also be incendiary; and armor-piercing
bullets that would also contain a tracing mixture. It was
thought that bullets of these types would be particularly valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
for aircraft use. While we had done considerable experimenting
along both lines, no satisfactory types had yet been developed.</p>

<p>There was another class of small arms for which we also had to
produce ammunition on a war scale. Our automatic pistols and
revolvers demanded .45-caliber ball cartridges. In normal times
the Frankford Arsenal had been almost our sole producer of these
cartridges, and it had attained an annual output of approximately
10,000,000 rounds of them. This quantity was nowhere nearly adequate
for our war needs, especially after the decision to equip our
troops much more numerously with pistols and revolvers than had
formerly been the case.</p>

<p>Consequently it was necessary for us to develop additional manufacturing
facilities for .45-caliber ammunition. We did this by placing
orders with some of the same manufacturers who were developing
the .30-caliber production. Because it was necessary for us to give
preference always to the rifle and machine-gun ammunition, the
manufacture of pistol cartridges was not carried through as rapidly
as some other phases of the ammunition program. However, a
satisfactory output was reached in time to meet the immediate
demands of our forces in the field, and this production was expanding
and keeping ahead of the increased needs for this sort of cartridges.
The total war production of .45-caliber ammunition by
the various factories was as follows:</p>

<p>Early in 1918 our Air Service field forces saw the need of a machine
gun of larger caliber than the quick-firing weapons in general use.
The flying service of the principal allies had developed an 11-millimeter
machine gun for use in attacking the captive balloons of the
enemy. This gun fired a projectile only slightly less than one-half
inch in diameter. To meet this new demand our Ordnance Department
found at the Colt factory about 1,000 Vickers machine guns
which were being built on order for the former Russian Government.
The department took over these guns and modified them to
take 11-millimeter ammunition, and that step made it necessary for
us to produce machine-gun cartridges for these new weapons.</p>

<p>We at once developed a modified French 11-millimeter tracer incendiary
cartridge, which in later use proved to be highly satisfactory.
In an experimental order the Frankford Arsenal turned out about
100,000 of these cartridges, while at the time the armistice was signed
the Western Cartridge Co. was prepared to produce this class of
ammunition on a large scale.</p>

<p>Certain American concerns before April, 1917, had been producing
8-millimeter ammunition for the French government for use in its
machine guns. When we entered the war our Ordnance Department
found it necessary to continue the manufacture of these cartridges
for the machine guns obtained from the French. Up to November
30, 1918, a total of 269,631,800 rounds had been produced under our
supervision. These cartridges were manufactured by the Western
Cartridge Co. and by the Remington Arms Co. at its Swanton
plant.</p>

<p>How well and amply we were producing ammunition for our machine
guns and rifles is indicated by the fact that our average monthly
production, based upon our showing in July, August, and September,
1918, was 277,894,000 rounds as against a monthly average for Great
Britain of 259,769,000 rounds and for France of 139,845,000.</p>

<p>Our total production of machine-gun and rifle ammunition during
the 19 months of warfare was 2,879,148,000 rounds, while in that
period England produced 3,486,127,000 rounds and France
2,983,675,000, but it must be remembered that they had been keyed
up to that voluminous production by three years of fighting and that
our monthly production rate indicated we would soon far surpass
them in quantities.</p>

<p>The following table shows how our total production of ammunition
for all small arms, including machine guns, rifles, pistols, and
revolvers, grew month by month during the war:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

TRENCH-WARFARE MATERIAL.</h3>


<p>Like many of the other war implements produced by the Ordnance
Department for use in France, the weapons employed in fighting
from the trenches were entirely novel to American industry; and in
the production of them we find the same story of the difficulties in
the adoption of foreign designs, of the development of our own
designs, of the delays encountered and mistakes made in equipping
a new industry from the ground up, but, finally, of the triumphant
arrival at quantity production in a marvelously brief time, considering
the obstacles which had to be overcome.</p>

<p>When the movements of armies in the great war ceased and they
were held in deadlock in the trenches, the fighters at once began devising
weapons with which they could kill each other from below ground.
For this purpose they borrowed from the experience of man running
back to time immemorial. They took a leaf from the book of the
Roman fire-ball throwers and developed the hand grenade beyond
the point to which it had been brought in the European warfare of
the last century. They called upon an industry which had once
existed solely for the amusement of the people, the fireworks industry,
for its golden rain and rainbow-hued stars for signals with
which to talk to each other by night. Other geniuses of the trenches
took empty cannon cartridges and, setting them up as ground mortars,
succeeded in throwing bombs from them across No Man's Land into
the enemy ranks. They even for a time resurrected the catapult
of Trojan days, although this device attained no great success.
But from all such activities new weapons of warfare sprang, crude
at first, but later refined as only modern science and manufacture
could perfect them.</p>

<p>America entered the war when this development of ordnance novelties
had reached an advanced state. It became necessary for us,
then, to make a rapid study of what had been done and then go
ahead with our own production either from foreign designs or with
inventions of our own.</p>

<p>To this end in April, 1917, a few days after we declared war with
Germany, the Trench Warfare Section was organized within the
Ordnance Department and given charge of the production of these
novelties. The section did not entirely confine itself to trench-warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
materials, since one of its chief production activities was concerned
with the manufacture of the various sorts of bombs to be dropped
from airplanes. Also, at the start of its existence it had charge of
the production of implements for fighting with poison gas and flame.
Although in large part this phase of its work was taken away from it
in the summer of 1917 and was later placed under the jurisdiction of
the newly organized Chemical Warfare Service, the Trench Warfare
Section continued to conduct certain branches of gas-warfare manufacture,
in particular the production of the famous Livens projectors
of gas and also the manufacture of the portable toxic-gas sets for
producing gas clouds from cylinders.</p>

<p>All in all, the Trench Warfare Section was charged with the responsibility
of producing some 47 devices, every one of them new to
American manufacture and some extremely difficult to make. The
backbone of the program consisted of the production of grenades,
both of the hand-thrown and the rifle-fired variety, trench mortars,
trench-mortar ammunition, pyrotechnics of various sorts, and bombs
for the airplanes, with their sighting and release mechanisms.</p>

<p>In the production of these new devices there arose a new form of
cooperation between Government and private manufacturers under
the tutelage of the Trench Warfare Section. The manufacturers engaged
in the production of various classes of these munition novelties
joined in formal associations. There was a Hand Grenade Manufacturers'
Association, under the capable leadership of William
Sparks, president of the Sparks-Withington Co., of Jackson, Mich.;
the Drop Bomb Manufacturers' Association, headed by J. L. Sinyard,
president of A. O. Smith Corporation, Milwaukee; the Six-inch
Trench-mortar Shell Manufacturers' Association, R. W. Millard,
president of Foster-Merriam Co., Meriden, Conn.; the Rifle Grenade
Manufacturers' Association, under the leadership of F. S. Briggs,
president of the Briggs &amp; Stratton Co., Milwaukee, Wis.; and the
Livens Projector Manufacturers' Association. A similar association
of manufacturers engaged in army contracts existed in the production
of small-arms ammunition; but in no other branch of the Ordnance
Department was the development of such cooperation carried on to
the extent of that fathered by the Trench Warfare Section.</p>

<p>The existence of these associations was of inestimable benefit in
securing the rapid development, standardization for quantity manufacture,
and production of these strange devices. Each association
had its president, its other officers, and its regular meetings. These
meetings were attended by the interested officers of the Trench
Warfare Section. In the meetings the experiments of the manufacturers
and the short-cut methods developed in their shops were
freely discussed; and, if modifications of design were suggested, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
questions were thrashed out in these meetings of practical technicians,
and all of the contractors simultaneously received the benefits.</p>

<p>The Trench Warfare Section produced its results under the handicap
of being low in the priority ratings, many other items of ordnance
being considered in Washington of more importance than the trench-fighting
materials and therefore entitled to first call upon raw materials
and transportation. In the priority lists the leader of 47 trench-warfare
articles, the 240-millimeter mortars, stood twenty-second,
and the others trailed after.</p>


<h4>GRENADES.</h4>

<p>The first of the trench-warfare weapons with which the rookie
soldier became acquainted was the hand grenade, since this, at
least in its practice or dummy form, was supplied to the training
camps in this country. To all intents and purposes the hand grenade
was a product of the war against Germany, although grenades had
been more or less used since explosives existed. All earlier grenades
had been crude devices with only limited employment in warfare,
but in the three years preceding America's participation in the war
the grenade had become a carefully built weapon.</p>

<p>The extent of our production of hand grenades may be seen in
the fact that when the effort was at its height 10,000 workers were
engaged exclusively in its manufacture. The firing mechanism of
the explosive grenades which we built was known as the Bouchon
assembly. In the production of this item 19 of every 20 workers
were women. In fact no other item in the entire ordnance field was
produced so exclusively by women. Incidentally, at no time during
the war was there a strike in any grenade factory.</p>

<p>For a long time in the trenches of France only one type of hand
grenade was used. This was the so-called defensive grenade, built
of stout metal which would fly into fragments when the interior
charge exploded. As might be expected, such a weapon was used
only by men actually within the trenches, the walls of which protected
the throwers from the flying fragments. But, as the war
continued, six other distinct kinds of grenades were developed,
America herself contributing one of the most important of them;
and during our war activities we were engaged in manufacturing all
seven.</p>

<p>The defensive, or fragmentation, type grenade was the commonest,
most numerous, and perhaps, the most useful of all of them. Another
important one, however, was that known as the offensive
grenade, and it was America's own contribution to trench warfare.
The body of the offensive grenade was made of paper, so that the
deadly effect of it was produced by the flame and concussion of the
explosion itself. It was quite sure to kill any man within 3 yards
of it when it went off, but it was safe to use in the open offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
movements, since there were no pieces of metal to fly back and hit
the thrower.</p>

<p>A third development was known as the gas grenade. It was built of
sheet metal, and its toxic contents were effective in making enemy
trenches and dugouts uninhabitable. A fourth, a grenade of similar
construction, was filled with phosphorus, instead of gas, and was
known as the phosphorus grenade. This grenade scattered burning
phosphorus over an area 3 to 5 yards in diameter and released a
dense cloud of white smoke. In open attacks upon machine-gun
nests phosphorus grenades were thrown in barrages to build smoke
screens for the attacking forces.</p>

<p>As a fifth class there was a combination hand and rifle grenade,
a British device adopted in our program. The sixth class of grenades
was known as the incendiary type. These were paper bombs filled
with burning material and designed for use against structures intended
to be destroyed by fire. Finally, in the seventh class were
the thermit grenades, built of terneplate and filled with a compound
containing thermit, which develops an intense heat while melting.
Thermit grenades were used principally to destroy captured guns.
One of them touched off in the breech of a cannon would fuse the
breech-block mechanism and destroy the usefulness of the weapon.</p>

<p>All of these grenades except the incendiary grenades used the
same firing mechanism, and the incendiary grenade firing mechanism
was the standard one modified in a single particular.</p>

<p>The earliest American requirement in this production was for
defensive grenades, of the fragmentation type. Our first estimate
was that we would need 21,000,000 of these for actual warfare
and 2,000,000 of the unloaded type for practice and training work.
But, as the war continued and the American plans developed in
scale, we saw we would require a much greater quantity than this;
and orders were finally placed for a total of 68,000,000 live grenades
and over 3,000,000 of the practice variety.</p>

<p>By August 20, 1917, the Trench Warfare Section had developed
the design and the drawings for the defensive grenade. The first
contract&mdash;for 5,000 grenades&mdash;was let to the Caskey-Dupree Co.
of Marietta, Ohio. This concern was fairly entitled to such preference,
because the experimentation leading up to the design for
this bomb was conducted almost entirely at its plant in Marietta.</p>

<p>Next came an interesting industrial development by a well-known
American concern which had previously devoted its exclusive energy
to the production of high-grade silverware, but which now, as a
patriotic duty, undertook to build the deadly defensive grenades.
This was the Gorham Manufacturing Co. of Providence, R. I. This
firm contracted to furnish complete, loaded grenades, ready for
shipment overseas, and was the only one to build and operate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
manufacturing and loading plant. Elsewhere contracts were let
for parts only, these parts to converge at the assembling plants
later; and such orders were rapidly placed until by the middle of
December, 1917, various industrial concerns were tooling up for a
total production of 21,000,000 of these missiles.</p>

<p>The grenade which these contractors undertook to produce was
an American product in its design, although modeled after grenades
already in use at the front. Its chief difference was in the firing
mechanism, where improvements, or what were then thought to be
improvements, had been installed to make it safer in the hands of the
soldier than the grenades then in use at the front. This firing
mechanism with its pivoted lever was, in fact, a radical departure
from European practice. The body of this grenade was of malleable
iron, and the grenade exploded with a force greater than that of
any in use in France.</p>

<p>The remodeling of factories, the building of machines, and the
manufacture of tools for this undertaking, pushed forward with
determined speed, was completed in from 90 to 120 days, and by April
almost all of the companies had reached the stage of quantity production.</p>

<p>And then, on May 9, 1918, came a cablegram from the American
Expeditionary Forces that brought the entire effort to an abrupt
halt. The officers of the American Expeditionary Forces in no
uncertain terms condemned the American defensive grenade. The
trouble was that in our anxiety to protect the American soldier
we had designed a grenade that was too safe. The firing mechanism
was too complicated. In the operation required to touch off the
fuse five movements were necessary on the part of the soldier, and
in this the psychology of a man in battle had not been taken sufficiently
into consideration. The well-known story of the negro soldier
who, in practice, threw his grenade too soon because he could feel
it "swelling" in his hand, applies to most soldiers in battle. In using
the new grenade the American soldier would not go through the
operations required to fire its fuse. Cases came to light, too, showing
that in the excitement of battle the American soldier forgot to
release the safety device, thus giving the German an opportunity
to hurl back the unexploded grenade.</p>

<p>As the result of this discovery all production was stopped in the
United States and the ordnance engineers began redesigning the
weapon. The incident meant that 15,000,000 rough castings of
grenade bodies, 3,500,000 assembled but empty grenades and 1,000,000
loaded grenades had to be salvaged, and that on July 1, 1918, the
production of live fragmentation grenades in this country was represented
by the figure zero. Some of the machinery used in the production
of the faulty grenades was useless and had to be replaced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
new, while the trained forces which had reached quantity production
in April had to be disbanded or transferred to other work while the
design was being changed.</p>

<p>By August 1 the new design had been developed on paper and
much of the new machinery required had been produced and installed
in the plants, which were ready to go ahead immediately with
the production. It is a tribute to the patriotism of the manufacturers
who lost time and money by this change that little complaint
was heard from them by the Government.</p>

<p>In the production of hand grenades the most difficult element of
manufacture and the item that might have held up the delivery of
completed mechanisms was the Bouchon assembly. There was an
abundant foundry capacity in the United States for the production
of gray-iron castings for grenade bodies, and so this part of the program
gave no anxiety. The Bouchon assembly threatened to be
the choke point. In order to assure the success of defensive-grenade
production, the Precision Castings Co. of Syracuse, N. Y., and the
Doehler Die Castings Co. of Toledo, Ohio, and Brooklyn, N. Y.,
worked their plants 24 hours a day until they had built up a reserve
of Bouchons and screw plugs and removed all anxiety from that
source. The total production of Bouchons eventually reached the
figure 64,600,000.</p>

<p>The first thought of the Ordnance Department was to produce
grenades by the assembling and quantitative method; that is, by the
production of parts in various plants and the assembling of those
parts in other plants. But, due to delay in railway shipments and
difficulties due to priorities, it was discovered that this method of
manufacture, however adaptable it might be to other items in the
ordnance program, was not a good thing in grenade production; and
when the war ended the tendency was all in the direction of having
the assembly contractors produce their own parts either by purchase
from subcontractors or by manufacture in their own plants.</p>

<p>The orders for the redesigned grenades called for the construction
of 44,000,000 of them. So rapidly had the manufacturers been able
to reach quantity production this time that a daily rate of 250,000 to
300,000 was attained by November 11, 1918, and by December 6,
less than a month after the fighting stopped, the factories had turned
out 21,054,339 defensive grenades.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the great effort in ordnance production
in this country was directed toward the American offensive expected
on a tremendous scale in the spring of 1919. Had the war
continued the fragmentation grenade program, in spite of the delays
encountered in its development, would have produced a sufficient
quantity of these weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Special consideration is due the following-named firms for their
efforts in developing the production of defensive grenades:</p>


<ul><li>Caskey-Dupree Co., Marietta, Ohio.</li>
<li>Spacke Machine &amp; Tool Co., Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>Stewart-Warner Speedometer Co., Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Miami Cycle &amp; Manufacturing Co., Middletown, Ohio.</li>
<li>American Radiator Co., Buffalo, N. Y.</li>
<li>International Harvester Co., Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Doehler Die Castings Co., Brooklyn, N. Y.</li>
<li>Precision Castings Co., Syracuse, N. Y.</li>
</ul>

<p>The American offensive grenade was largely the production of the
Single Service Package Corporation of New York, both in the development
of its design and in its manufacture. The body of this
grenade was built of laminated paper spirally wound and waterproofed
by being dipped in paraffine. The top of this body was a
die casting, into which the firing mechanism was screwed. Practically
no changes were made in the design of this weapon from the
time it was first produced, and the production record is an excellent
one.</p>

<p>Our earliest thought was that we would need some 7,000,000 of
these grenades and orders for that quantity of bodies were placed in
January and March, 1918, with the Single Service Package Corporation.
Then it became necessary to discover factories which could produce
the metal caps. The orders for these were first placed with the
Acme Die Castings Co. and the National Lead Casting Co. for 3,375,000
castings from each concern. But these companies failed to make
satisfactory deliveries, and in May, 1918, a contract for 5,000,000
caps was let to the Doehler Die Castings Co. which reached quantity
production in August. After that the Single Service Package Corporation,
the chief contractor, forged ahead in its work and on November
11 was producing the bodies for offensive grenades at the rate of
55,000 to 60,000 daily. By December 6, 1918, the Government had
accepted 6,179,321 completed bodies. The signing of the armistice
brought to an end a project to build 17,599,000 additional grenades
of this type.</p>

<p>The production of gas grenades offered some peculiar difficulties.
We set out at first to produce 3,684,530 of them. By January, 1918,
the engineers of the Ordnance Department had completed the plans
and specifications for the American gas grenade, and on February 12,
an order for 1,000,000 of them was placed with the Maxim Silencer
Co., of Hartford, Conn.</p>

<p>The gas grenades were to be delivered at the filling plants complete
except for the detonator thimbles, which seal both gas and phosphorus
grenades and act as sockets for the firing mechanism. It was seen
that the construction of these thimbles might be a choke point in the
construction of grenades of both types, and orders were early placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
for them&mdash;1,500,000 to be delivered by the Maxim Silencer Co. and
an equal quantity by the Bassic Co., of Bridgeport, Conn. On December
6, 1918, these concerns had produced 1,982,731 detonator
thimbles.</p>

<p>The body of the gas grenade is built of two sheet-metal cups welded
together to be gas-tight. Since, when we started out on this production,
we did not know what kind of gas would be used or at what
pressure it would be held within the grenade, we set the specifications
to make grenade bodies to hold an air pressure of 200 pounds. The
welding of the cups frequently failed to hold such pressure, so that the
rejections of gas-grenade bodies under this test ran as high as 50 per
cent. But in June, 1918, the gas for the grenades had been developed,
and we were thereupon able to reduce the pressure of the
standard test to 50 pounds. Under such a test the bodies readily
passed inspection.</p>

<p>In September, 1918, we let additional contracts for gas grenades&mdash;500,000
to the Evinrude Motor Co., of Milwaukee; 500,000 to the
John W. Brown Manufacturing Co., of Columbus, Ohio; and 400,000
to the Zenite Metal Co., of Indianapolis.</p>

<p>On November 11 gas grenade bodies were being produced at the
rate of 22,000 per day, and the total production up to December 6
was 936,394.</p>

<p>The phosphorus grenade was similar to the gas grenade in construction.
The plans and specifications for this weapon were ready
in January, 1918. In February the following contracts were let:
Metropolitan Engineering Co., Brooklyn, N. Y., 750,000; Evinrude
Motor Co., Milwaukee, 750,000; Zenite Metal Co., Indianapolis,
500,000. On December 6, 1918, these concerns had delivered a total
of 521,948 phosphorus grenade bodies.</p>

<p>The difficulties which had been experienced in the production of
gas grenades were repeated in this project. The Evinrude Co. was
especially quick in getting over the obstacles to quantity production.
The Metropolitan Engineering Co. was already engaged with large
orders for adapters and boosters in the heavy-gun ammunition manufacture
for the Ordnance Department and found that the order for
phosphorus grenades conflicted to a considerable extent with its
previous war work. The matter was thrashed out in the Ordnance
Department, which gave the priority in this plant to the adapters
and boosters, with the result that this firm was able to make only a
small contribution to the total production of phosphorus grenade
bodies.</p>

<p>The development of thermit grenades was still in the experimental
stage when the armistice was signed. There was no actual production
in this country of grenades of this character. In October, however,
the development of the grenade in design had reached a stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
where we felt justified in letting a contract for 655,450 die-casting
parts to the Doehler Die Castings Co., at its Toledo plant, and for an
equal number of bodies with firing-mechanism assemblies to the
Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corporation at Chicago.</p>

<p>The incendiary grenade not only did not get out of the development
stage, but even a perfected model was regarded as of doubtful value
by the officers of the American Expeditionary Forces. Nevertheless,
the Chemical Warfare Service was of the opinion that such a grenade
should be worked out, and an order for 81,000 had been given to the
Celluloid Co., of Newark, N. J. Experimental work was progressing
satisfactorily when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>When the war ended, we were adapting to American manufacture
a combination hand and rifle phosphorus grenade, borrowed from the
English. The body of this grenade was built of terneplate and it had
a removable stem, so that it could be thrown by hand or fired from
the end of a service rifle. The American Can Co. built 1,000 of these
to try out the design and strengthen the weak features.</p>

<h4>RIFLE GRENADES.</h4>

<p>In the construction of our rifle grenades there was another unfortunate
experience due to a faulty design. The rifle grenade fits in a
holder at the muzzle of an ordinary service rifle. When the rifle is
fired the bullet passes through a hole in the middle of the grenade,
and the gases of the discharge following the bullet throw the grenade
approximately 200 yards. Any man within 75 yards of an exploding
rifle grenade is likely to be wounded or killed. The rifle grenade is
used both as a defensive and offensive weapon, since the firer is well
out of range of the exploding missile.</p>

<p>In developing a rifle grenade for American manufacture our
engineers adopted the French Viven-Bessiere type. The French
service ammunition is larger than ours, and it was therefore necessary
to design our grenade with a smaller hole. But in the anxiety to
produce this weapon in the shortest time possible the models were
not sufficiently tested, and no consideration was taken of the difference
in design between a French bullet and an American bullet. The
result was that the French grenade did not function well with our
ammunition, due to the splitting of the Springfield bullet as it passed
through the grenade. The result was that in May, 1918, several
months after the manufacture of this grenade had been in progress,
the entire undertaking was canceled pending the development of
new designs; and 3,500,000 completed grenades had to be salvaged.</p>

<p>The original contract for rifle grenades had been let to the Westinghouse
Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co. of Pittsburgh. This called for
the production of all parts by the Westinghouse Co. and the assembling
of them in the Westinghouse plant to the number of 5,000,000
grenades. But there was such a diversity of material employed in
the manufacture of rifle grenades that succeeding contracts were let
for parts and for assembling separately.</p>

<p>After the rifle grenade had been redesigned new contracts were let
for a total of 30,115,409 of them. In August, a few weeks later,
the daily production of these grenades in the various plants had
reached a total of 130,000 and by the end of October the daily production
was 250,000. The goal toward which this production was
aiming was the expected spring offensive of the American Expeditionary
Forces in 1919. We should have met this event adequately
because, while only 685,200 American rifle grenades had actually been
shipped overseas when the fighting ceased, we had 20,000,000 of them
ready for loading at that time and the production was already heavy
and constantly increasing.</p>

<h4>TOXIC GAS EQUIPMENT.</h4>

<p>America entered the war nearly two years after the Germans had
made their first gas attack. In those intervening months gas
warfare had grown to be a science in itself, requiring special organizations
with each army to handle it.</p>

<p>The employment of toxic gas had developed along several lines.
The original attack by the Germans upon the mask-less Canadians at
Ypres had been in the form of a gas cloud from projectors, these latter
being pressure tanks with nozzle outlets. For some time the Germans
continued the use of gas solely by this method. Retaliation on the
part of the allies quickly followed. However, the employment of
gas cloud attacks involved great labor of preparation and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
absolutely dependent upon certain combinations of weather conditions.
In consequence, the launching of a gas attack in this form
could not be timed with regard to other tactical operations. Therefore
the allies were put to the necessity of developing other means
of throwing toxic gases, and this they did by inclosing the gas in
shell shot from the big guns of the artillery, in grenades thrown
by hand from the trenches, and&mdash;most effectively of all&mdash;by the
agency of an ingenious invention of the British known as the Livens
projector.</p>

<p>The Livens projector was deadly in its effect, since it could throw
suddenly and in great quantity gas bombs, or drums, into the enemy's
ranks. It is notable that although the British used this device with
great success throughout much of the latter period of the war, and
though the French and Americans also adopted it and used it freely,
the Germans were never able to discover what the device was that
threw such havoc into their ranks, nor were they ever able to produce
anything that was similar to it. The Livens projector remained a
deep secret until the close of hostilities, and the Government offices
in Washington, where the design was adapted to American manufacture,
and the American plants producing the parts, were always closely
guarded against enemy espionage.</p>

<p>Without going into details of the construction of the Livens projector
it may be said that it was usually fired by electricity in sets of
25 or multiples thereof. The drums, which were cylindrical shell
about 24 inches long and 8 inches in diameter, were ejected from long
steel tubes, or barrels, buried in the ground resting against pressed-steel
base plates. At the throwing of an electric switch a veritable
rain of these big shell, as many as 2,500 of them sometimes, with
their lethal contents, would come hurtling down upon the enemy.
The Livens projectors could throw their gas drums nearly a mile.</p>

<p>The projector was entirely a new type of munition for our manufacturers
to handle. The Trench Warfare Section of the Ordnance
Department took up the matter late in 1917 and by May, 1918, had
designed the weapon for home manufacture. Early in June the
contracts were allotted for barrels and gas drums, or shell. The
production of barrels was exclusively in the hands of the National
Tube Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa., and the Harrisburg Pipe &amp; Pipe-Bending
Co., of Harrisburg, Pa. These companies reached the production
stage in August, 1918, and completed about 63,000 barrels before the
armistice was signed. Their respective plants reached a daily production
rate of approximately 600 barrels per day.</p>

<p>Somewhat later in the spring of 1918 the contracts for base plates,
on which the barrels rest when ready for firing, muzzle covers, and
for various other accessories were closed. Over 100,000 base plates
were produced by the Gier Pressed Steel Co., of Lansing, Mich., and
the American Pulley Co., of Philadelphia, Pa. The Perkins-Campbell
Co., of Philadelphia, built the muzzle covers, 66,180 of them.
Cartridge cases were manufactured by Art Metal (Inc.), of Newark,
N. J., and the Russakov Can Co., of Chicago, the former producing
288,838 and the latter 47,511.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ensign-Bickford Co., of Simsbury, Conn., produced 334,300
fuses for Livens shell; the Artillery Fuse Co., of Wilmington, Del.,
assembled 26,000 firing mechanisms; the E. I. du Pont Co., at its
Pompton Lakes (N. J.) plant, manufactured 20,000 detonators, and
487,350 detonators were produced by the Aetna Explosives Co., at
Port Ewan, N. Y.; while the American Can Co., at Lowell, Mass., assembled
256,231 firing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Shear wire pistols were used in the operation of the Livens projector.
The Edison Phonograph Co., of Orange, N. J., produced
181,900 of these, and the Artillery Fuse Co., of Wilmington, Del.,
11,747. The adapters and boosters of the shell were all built by the
John Thompson Press, of New York. The Waterbury Brass Goods
Co., of Waterbury, Conn., made the fuse casing. Adapters and
boosters to the number of 334,500 were turned out by the former, and
299,900 fuse casings by the latter.</p>

<p>The manufacture of gas drums for the projectors was delayed for
some time because of difficulties in welding certain parts of the
drums. Acetylene and arc welding processes were tried out, and a
good many shell were made by such welding; but the lack of expert
welders for these processes, and the rejections of shell due to leakage
in the welded joints, caused the manufacturer to turn to fire welding,
the process for which had been developed by the Air-tight Steel Tank
Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa. At the time the armistice was signed the
welding problem had been overcome and the production was going
forward at a rate to meet the requirements of the expected fighting
in the spring of 1919. The shell delivered were produced as follows:</p>

<p>By the Federal Pressed Steel Co., of Milwaukee, Wis., 5,609; by
the Pressed Steel Tank Co., also of Milwaukee, 20,536; by the Air-tight
Steel Tank Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa., 600; by the National Tube
Co., of Pittsburgh, 27,098; by the Truscon Steel Co., of Youngstown,
Ohio, 19,880. The entire Livens shell program, as it existed in
November, 1918, called for the production of 334,000 shell.</p>


<h4>TRENCH MORTARS.</h4>

<p>The production of trench mortars was not only an important part
of our ordnance program but it was an undertaking absolutely new
to American experience. Not only did we have to produce mortars,
but we had to supply them with shell in great quantities, this latter
in itself an enterprise of no mean proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Some seven different types of mortars were in use when we came
into the war. Our ordnance program contemplated the manufacture
of all seven of them, but we actually succeeded in bringing only four
types into production. These four were the British Newton-Stokes
mortars of the 3-inch, 4-inch, and 6-inch calibers, and the French 240-millimeter
mortar, which had also been adopted by the British. As
usual in the adoption of foreign devices, we had to redesign these
weapons to make them adaptable to American shop methods. We
encountered much difficulty throughout the whole job, largely because
of insufficient information furnished from abroad, and because
in spite of this handicap we had to produce mortars and ammunition
that would be interchangeable with French and British munitions
stocks.</p>

<p>The first one of these weapons which we took up for production
here was the 3-inch Newton-Stokes. The first contract for the manufacture
of mortars of this size was placed with the Crane Co., of Chicago,
on November 8, 1917, for 1,830 mortars. This concern at once
arranged with the Ohio Seamless Tube Co., of Shelby, Ohio, for the
drawing of steel tubes for the mortar barrels. This latter concern,
however, was already handling large contracts for the Navy and for
the aircraft program, and these operations took priority over the
mortar contracts. But the Crane Co. took advantage of the interim
to build the accessories for the weapons&mdash;the tripods, clinometers,
base plates, and tool boxes. In the spring of 1918 the company received
the first barrel tubes and began producing completed weapons.
But when these mortars were sent to the proving ground the test-firing
deformed the barrels and broke the metal bases. Finally it was
decided that the propelling explosive used was not a suitable one for
the purpose. Another was substituted. The new propellant permitted
as great a range of fire without damage to the mortar in firing.</p>

<p>The Crane Co. was eventually able to reach a production of 33 of
the 3-inch mortars a day, and up to December 5, 1918, it had built
1,803 completed weapons, together with the necessary tools and
spare parts. In the early fall of 1918 an additional contract for 677
of these mortars was placed with the Crane Co. and another for 2,000
mortars of this size with the International Harvester Co., of Chicago.
Neither of these two latter contracts ever came to the production
stage.</p>

<p>A few days after the original contract for 3-inch mortars was let
the Trench Warfare Section took up the matter of producing ammunition
for these weapons. Two sorts of shell were to be required&mdash;live
shell filled with high explosive and practice shell made of
malleable iron. The original program adopted in November, 1917,
called for the production of 5,342,000 live shell for the 3-inch mortars
and 1,500,000 practice shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan was adopted of building these shell of lap-welded, 3-inch
steel tubing, cut into proper lengths. The contracts for the finished
machined and assembled shell were placed with the General Motors
Corporation at its Saginaw (Mich.) plant, with H. C. Dodge (Inc.),
at South Boston, Mass., and with the Metropolitan Engineering Co.,
of Brooklyn, N. Y. In order to facilitate production, the Government
agreed to furnish the steel tubing. For this purpose it ordered
from the National Tube Co., of Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,618,929 pieces of
steel tubing, each 11 inches in length, and from the Allegheny Steel
Co., at Brakenridge, Pa., 2,332,319 running feet of tubing. These
tube contracts were filled by the early spring of 1918.</p>

<p>The railroad congestion of February and March, 1918, held up the
delivery of tubing, but the assembly plants utilized the time in tooling
up for the future production. All the plants thereafter soon reached
a quantity production, the General Motors Corporation in particular
tuning up its shop system until it was able to reach a maximum
daily production in a 10-hour shift of 35,618 completed shell.</p>

<p>The casting of malleable iron bodies for the practice shell of this
caliber was turned over to the Erie Malleable Iron Co., of Erie, Pa.,
and to the National Malleable Castings Co., with plants at Cleveland,
Chicago, Indianapolis, and Toledo. The former concern cast 196,673
bodies and the latter 1,015,005. The Gorham Manufacturing Co., of
Providence, R. I.; the Standard Parts Co., of Cleveland, Ohio; and
the New Process Gear Corporation, of Syracuse, N. Y., machined
and assembled the practice shell. When the armistice was declared,
these three contracts were approximately seven-tenths complete.</p>

<p>We were dissatisfied with our 3-inch shell, for the reason that
they tumbled in air and were visible to the eye. The French had
developed a mortar shell on the streamline principle which was
invisible in flight and had twice the range of ours. Had the war
continued the Trench Warfare Section would have produced
streamline shell for mortars.</p>

<p>The second mortar project undertaken was the manufacture of the
240-millimeter weapon. This was the largest mortar which we produced,
its barrel having a diameter of approximately 10 inches. It
proved to be one of the toughest nuts to crack in the whole mortar
undertaking. The British designs of this French weapon we found
to be quite unsuited to our factory methods, and for the sake of
expediency we frequently modified them in the course of the development.
The total contracts called for the production of 938 mortars.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the manufacture of this and of other larger
mortars would fall into three phases. The forging of barrels,
breechblocks, and breech slides was a separate type of work, and we
allotted the contracts for this work to the Standard Forging Co., of
Indiana Harbor, Ind. The machining of these parts to the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dimensions required by the design was an entirely separate phase of
manufacturing, and we placed this work with the American Laundry
Machine Co., of Cincinnati. Still a third class of work was that of
assembling the completed mortars, and this contract went to the
David Lupton Sons Co., of Philadelphia, who also engaged to manufacture
the metal and timber bases and firing mechanisms. These
big mortars had to have mobile mountings, and the contract for the
mortar carts we placed with the International Harvester Co., of
Chicago. These contracts were signed in December, 1917.</p>

<p>The Lupton plant had difficulty in securing the heavy machinery
it needed for this and for other mortar contracts, its machinery
being held up by the freight congestion. Early in 1918 the American
Expeditionary Forces advised us to redesign the 240-millimeter
mortar to give it a stronger barrel. Consequently all work was
stopped until this could be done. The first mortars of the new
design to be tested were still unsatisfactory with respect to the
strength of the barrels; and as a consequence the Standard Forging
Co. urged that nickel steel be substituted for basic open-hearth steel
as the material for the barrels. This change proved to be justified.</p>

<p>There was also trouble at the shops of the American Laundry
Machine Co., its equipment not having the precision to do machining
of the type required in these weapons. Accordingly a new machining
contract was made with the Symington-Anderson Co., of Rochester,
N. Y., which concern was eventually able to reach a production of
20 machined barrels per week.</p>

<p>In all we produced 24 of the 240-millimeter mortars in this country.
Certain of the parts were manufactured up to the total requirements
of the contracts, but others were not built in such numbers. The
International Harvester Co. built all 999 carts ordered.</p>

<p>The production of shell for these big mortars was another difficult
undertaking. After consultation with manufacturers we designed
shell of two different types. One of these was a shell of pressed
plates welded together longitudinally; and a contract for the production
of 283,096 of these was placed with the Metropolitan Engineering
Co. The other form was that of two steel hemispheres welded together.
The Michigan Stamping Co., of Detroit, undertook to build
50,000 of these.</p>

<p>These shell contracts were placed in December, 1917. The Michigan
Stamping Co. had to wait five months before it could secure and
install its complete equipment of machinery. It was September
before all of the difficulties in the Detroit plant's project could be
overcome and quantity production could be started. The concern
eventually, before and after the signing of the armistice, built 9,185
shell of this type at a maximum rate of 56 per day.</p>

<p>Greater promise seemed to be held forth by the Metropolitan
Engineering Co.'s project to build shell of pressed-out plates, elec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>trically
welded. The Government undertook to furnish the steel
plates for this work and secured from the American Rolling Mills
Co., of Middletown, Ohio, a total production of 6,757 tons of them.
The Metropolitan Engineering Co. had great difficulty in perfecting
a proper welding process; and the concern lost a great deal of money
on the contract, yet cheerfully continued its development without
prospect of recompense in order that we might have in this country
the knowledge of how to build such shell. In all, including production
after the armistice was signed, the Metropolitan Engineering
Co. built 136,189 shell bodies of this size at a maximum rate of 987
per day.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1918 a single-piece shell body of the 240-millimeter
size, produced by a deep-drawing process, was worked out.
A contract for 125,000 of them was given to the Ireland &amp; Matthews
Manufacturing Co., of Detroit, Mich. The armistice brought this
contract to an end before it had produced any shell of this new and
most promising type.</p>

<p>Early in 1918 we received the first samples of the 6-inch trench
mortar. By April all the plans were ready for American production.
Again this work was divided by types. The National Tube Co., of
Pittsburgh, contracted to build 510 rough forgings of mortar barrels
at its Christy Park plant. The Symington-Anderson Co. undertook
to machine these barrels. The David Lupton Sons Co. agreed to
assemble the mortars, as well as to produce the metal and timber
bases for them.</p>

<p>The first machined barrels reached the Lupton plant in June and
found bases ready for them. But, as the assembling was in progress,
the American Expeditionary Forces cabled that the British producers
of mortars had changed their designs, and that we must suspend
our manufacture until we also could adopt the changes. The altered
plans reached us some weeks later; yet, nevertheless, we were able
to make good our original promise to deliver 48 of the 6-inch Newton-Stokes
mortars at the port of embarkation in October, 1918.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had increased the contracts by an additional requirement
of 1,577 mortars of this size. The National Tube Co. eventually
reached a maximum daily production of 60 barrel forgings. The
Symington-Anderson Co. machined the barrels finally at a 33-per-day
clip. As many as 11 proof-fired guns per day came from the
David Lupton Sons Co.</p>

<p>An interesting fact in connection with the production of shell for
the 6-inch mortars is that they were built principally by American
makers of stoves. The 6-inch mortar-shell bodies were of cast iron
instead of steel, and thus were adaptable to manufacture in stove
works. Each shell weighed 40 pounds without its explosive charge.
Such shell were used at the front for heavy demolition purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>The contracts for these shell were placed in March, 1918. The
Trench Warfare Section was immediately called upon to secure favorable
priority for the pig iron required for this purpose. The various
stove works did not have the necessary machinery for building these
shell, and so a special equipment in each case had to be built. At the
tests the first castings which came through the foundry were found
to leak, and this required further experiments in the design, holding
up production until July, 1918.</p>

<p>Because of the many troubles encountered in this work the various
stove makers in the summer of 1918 formed an association which they
called the Six-inch Trench-mortar Shell Manufacturers' Association.
This association held monthly meetings and its members visited the
various plants where shell castings were being made. The United
States Radiator Corporation, the Foster-Merriam Co., and the
Michigan Stove Co., were especially active in improving methods
for making these shell.</p>

<p>The various concerns producing 6-inch mortar shell and the
amounts turned out were as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>The following concerns shortly before the armistice was signed received
contracts for the production of 6-inch mortar shell, orders
ranging in quantity from 50,000 to 150,000, but none of these concerns
started production:</p>


<ul><li>Wm. Crane Co., Jersey City, N. J.</li>
<li>Frontier Iron Works, Buffalo, N. Y.</li>
<li>Henry E. Pridmore, (Inc.), Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Best Foundry Co., Bedford, Ohio.</li>
<li>McCord &amp; Co., Chicago, Ill.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was not until July, 1918, that the plans were ready for the 4-inch
Newton-Stokes trench mortars. The American Expeditionary Forces
estimated that they would require 480 of these weapons. A total of
500 drawn barrel tubes was ordered from the Ohio Seamless Tube Co.,
of Shelby, Ohio. This concern was able to ship one-fifth of its order
within 10 days after receiving it. The barrels were sent to the Rock
Island Arsenal for machining. The Crane Co., of Chicago, held the
contract for building the bases, tripods, spare parts, and tools, and
also for the assembling of the completed mortars. This factory was
already equipped with tools for this work, since it had been building
similar parts for 3-inch mortars. Consequently, the Crane Co., in
August, almost within a month of receiving its contract, was producing
completed 4-inch mortars and sending them to the Rock
Island Arsenal for proof firing. The Ohio Seamless Tube Co. reached
a high daily production of 83 barrel forgings per day; the Rock Island
Arsenal, 10 machined barrels per day; and the Crane Co., 19 assembled
mortars per day.</p>

<p>We planned to build only smoke shell and gas shell for the 4-inch
mortars. Large contracts for various parts of these shell were
placed and the enterprise was gaining great size when the armistice
was declared, but no finished smoke shell and only a few gas shell for
4-inch trench mortars had been produced. The contracts for the smoke
shell were let in October, 1918, and work had not started further
than the procurement of raw material before the armistice came. A
large number of contractors expected to produce the parts for the
4-inch gas shell, and considerable of the raw materials were actually
produced; but only one of the machining and assembling contractors,
the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Co., actually completed any of these
shell, and production at this plant did not start until December 5,
1918.</p>

<h4>TOXIC GAS SETS.</h4>

<p>Another extensive project in the trench-warfare program was the
manufacture of the so-called toxic gas sets. Each set consisted of
a one-man portable cylinder equipped with a nozzle and a firing
mechanism. Each set was ready for firing as soon as it was placed
in position.</p>

<p>In August, 1918, the toxic-gas-set project was taken up by the
Trench Warfare Section. Contracts for cylinders were awarded to
the Ireland-Matthews Manufacturing Co., of Detroit, Mich., who
produced 13,642 cylinders, and to the American Car &amp; Foundry Co.
at its Milton, Pa., plant, which concern turned out 11,046 cylinders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Reinforcing, Brazing &amp; Machine Co. produced
9,765 valves for the cylinders in two months after receiving the
contract. The Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Co., of Stamford,
Conn., which received the contract for nozzles on September 5, 1918,
manufactured 20,501 of them before the armistice was signed; and
J. N. Smith &amp; Co., of Detroit, Mich., who did not receive their contract
until September 26, built 3,252 nozzles before the fighting
stopped. The Liquid Carbolic Co., of Chicago, and the Ruud Manufacturing
Co., of Pittsburgh, had the contracts for the firing mechanism;
but none of these was produced because at the time the
armistice was signed the firing mixture to be used with the cylinders
had not been developed.</p>

<p>In connection with the production of materials for gas warfare the
Ordnance Department also designed several types of containers
for the shipment of poison gas, these including not only the portable
cylinders but larger tanks and even tank cars.</p>


<h4>PYROTECHNICS.</h4>

<p>A few years ago, when we allowed the adventurous American boy
to blow off his fingers and hands by the indiscriminate use of explosives
in celebrating the Nation's birthday, we had an extensive fireworks
industry in this country. But the spread of the sane Fourth reform
had virtually killed this manufacture, so that when we entered the
war there were only three or four plants in the United States making
fireworks. These concerns kept the trade secrets closely guarded.
However, as we approached the brink of hostilities it was evident
we would have to build up a large production capacity for the pyrotechnics
demanded by the various new types of fighting which had
sprung into existence since 1914. Fireworks were extensively used
principally for signaling at night and as an aid to aviators in the dark.</p>

<p>One of the men to foresee this need was Lewis Nixon, who had
long been in the public eye and was known especially for his advocacy
of an American merchant marine. He organized a pyrotechnics
concern known as the Nixon Fulgent Products Co., built a plant at
Brunswick, N. J., and was ready to talk business with the Government
when the war began.</p>

<p>Also there had long been in existence that perennial delight of
children and adults alike known as Paine's Fireworks, whose spectacular
exhibitions are familiar to most city dwellers in the United
States. This concern had its own manufacturing plant, which was
ready to expand to meet Government war requirements.</p>

<p>In addition, two other concerns of the formerly declining industry
were ready to increase their facilities and produce pyrotechnics for
war purposes. These were the Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., of
New York, and the National Fireworks Co., of West Hanover, Mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
The four concerns proved to be able to meet every war requirement
we had.</p>

<p>Prior to the war some few military pyrotechnics had been procured
by the Signal Corps, the Coast Artillery, the Engineer Corps, and
also by the Navy; but on September 27, 1917, the design of all Army
pyrotechnics was centralized in the Trench Warfare Section.</p>

<p>Much experimentation was necessary before specifications could be
prepared, since the entire fire-signaling field had long been in confusion.
We had made our own designs and were proceeding with production
in the spring of 1918, when the American Expeditionary Forces
made the positive recommendation that the entire French program
of pyrotechnics be adopted by the United States. This meant a
fresh start in the business, but nevertheless pyrotechnic devices were
developed to meet all of our needs. These devices included signal
rockets, parachute rockets, signal pistols and their ammunition,
position and signal lights, flares, smoke torches, and lights to be
thrown by the V. B. discharger, the French device attached to the
end of the rifle in which a rifle grenade fits.</p>

<p>At the outset of our efforts we started to build signal rockets,
position lights, rifle lights, signal lights, and lights for use with the
Very signal pistol. The Very signal pistol, which we adopted first,
had the caliber of a 10-gauge shotgun, and its cartridges resembled
shotgun shells in appearance, although containing Roman candle
balls of various colors instead of leaden shot. The orders from
abroad in the spring of 1918 changed the caliber of the Very pistol to
25 millimeters and brought into our requirements some 16 different
styles of star and parachute cartridges. In addition to these, there
were required about 20 styles of star and parachute cartridges for
the French V. B. discharger. The recommendations from France
brought in 13 new styles of signal rockets, as well as smoke torches,
wing-tip flares for airplanes, parachute flares for lighting the ground
under bombing airplanes, and also 12 styles of cartridges for a new
35-millimeter Very pistol for the use of aviators.</p>

<p>After we received these instructions there was great uncertainty
here as to the quantity of each item that should be produced; and
this matter was not settled until August 5, 1918, when an enormous
program of requirements was issued. At first it seemed that the
Government itself must build new factories to take care of these
needs, but a careful examination showed that the existing facilities
could be expanded to take care of the production. The placing of
contracts in this undertaking was under way when the armistice
stopped the work.</p>

<p>The following table indicates the size of the pyrotechnic undertaking
and also what was accomplished. All of this production came
from the plants of the four companies which have been named. In
addition to the fireworks themselves, accessories were produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
a number of other concerns. The Japan Paper Co., New York City,
manufactured and imported from Japan approximately 3,000,000
paper parachutes. The Remington Arms Co., New Haven, Conn.,
built about 2,500,000 10-gauge signal-pistol cartridges, except for the
stars they contained. The Empire Art Metal Co., College Point,
N. Y., produced nearly 2,000,000 Very pistol cartridge cases. The
Winchester Repeating Arms Co., Bridgeport, Conn., supplied nearly
5,000,000 primers for these cartridges. Rose Bros. &amp; Co., Lancaster,
Pa., produced 65,600 silk parachutes for Very cartridges. Cheney
Bros., South Manchester, Conn.; D. G. Dery (Inc.), Allentown, Pa.;
Stehli Silk Corporation, New York City; Sauquoit Silk Co., Philadelphia;
Lewis Roessel &amp; Co., Hazleton, Pa.; Schwarzenback-Huber
Co., New York City; and the Duplane Silk Corporation, Hazleton,
Pa., produced a total of 1,231,728 yards of silk for parachutes to
float airplane flares. The parachutes themselves for the airplane
flares, a total of 28,570 of them, were manufactured by the Duplane
Silk Corporation; Folmer-Clogg Co., Lancaster, Pa.; and Jacob Gerhardt
Co., Hazleton, Pa. The Edw. G. Budd Manufacturing Co.,
Philadelphia, built 41,020 metal cases for the airplane flares.</p>

<p>We also contracted for the production of many thousands of Very
signal pistols. Before the original program was canceled the Remington
Arms Co. had produced 24,460 of the 10-gauge pistols in contracts
calling for a total output of 35,000.</p>

<p>In August, 1918, we let contracts for 135,000 of the 25-millimeter
pistols and for approximately 30,000 of the 35-millimeter pistols.
The A. H. Fox Gun Co. completed 4,193 of the smaller pistols and the
Scott &amp; Fetzger Machine Co. turned out 7,750 of them. Other concerns
which had taken contracts but had not come into production
when the armistice was signed were the National Tool &amp; Manufacturing
Co., the Doehler Die Castings Co., the Hammond Typewriter
Co., and Parker Bros.</p>

<p>Considerable experimental work of an interesting nature was
carried out looking toward the development of incendiary devices.
Three types of flame projectors, flaming bayonets, an airplane
destroyer, incendiary darts, and the smoke knapsack were among the
projects undertaken. Owing in large measure to changes in requirements
by the American Expeditionary Forces none of these devices
was actually turned out on any considerable scale.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

MISCELLANEOUS ORDNANCE EQUIPMENT.</h3>


<p>The miscellaneous ordnance equipment of the American soldier in
the recent war&mdash;that is, articles which he carried with him and
which added to his comfort, his safety, or his efficiency as a fighter&mdash;while
in many respects identical with the equipment used by our
troops for many years, at the same time contained several novelties.</p>

<p>In the novelty class were helmets and armor. There is a widespread
impression that helmets and body armor passed away with
the invention of gunpowder and because of that invention. This
impression is not at all true. Body armor came to its highest development
long after gunpowder was in common use in war. The sixteenth
century witnessed the most extensive use of armor; yet at
that time guns and pistols formed an important part of the equipment
of every army, and even a weapon which is generally fancied
to be ultramodern, the revolver, had been invented.</p>

<p>The fact is that not gunpowder but tactics caused the decline of
armor. Not that armor was unable to stop many types of projectiles
shot from guns, but that its weight hampered swift maneuvering,
caused it to be laid aside by the soldier. The decline of armor may
be said to date from the Thirty Years' War. The armies in that
period, and particularly that of the Swedes, began making long
marches for surprise attacks, and the body armor of the troops was
found to be a hindrance in such tactics. Thereafter armor went out
of fashion.</p>

<p>Yet it never completely disappeared in warfare. Gen. Rochambeau
is said to have worn body armor at the siege of Yorktown. Great
numbers of corselets and headpieces were worn in the Napoleonic
wars. The corselet which John Paul Jones wore in his fight with the
Serapis is preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The Japanese army was mailed with good armor as late as 1870.
Breastplates were worn to some extent in the Civil War in the United
States, and an armor factory was actually established at New Haven,
Conn., about 1862. In the museum at Richmond, Va., is an equipment
of armor taken from a dead soldier in one of the trenches at
the siege of that city. There was a limited use of armor in the Franco-Prussian
War. Some of the Japanese troops carried shields at Port
Arthur. Helmets were worn in the Boer War. A notorious Aus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>tralian
bandit in the eighties for a long time defied armed posses to
capture him because he wore armor and could stand off entire squads
of policemen firing at him with Martini rifles at close range.</p>

<p>Thus it can not be said that armor, in coming into use again in the
great war, was resurrected; it was merely revived. In its static condition
during most of the four-year period, the war against Germany
was one in which armor might profitably be used. This opportunity
could scarcely be overlooked, and indeed it was not. Everybody
knows of the helmets that were in general use; yet body armor itself
was coming into favor again, and only the welcome but unexpected
end of hostilities prevented it, in all probability, from becoming again
an important part of the equipment of a soldier.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the attenuated but persistent use of armor by
soldiers during the past two centuries and of the demand of the aristocratic
for helmets and armor as ornaments, the armorer's trade had
been kept alive from the days of Gustavus Adolphus to the present.
The war efforts of the United States in 1917 and 1918 demanded a
wide range of human talents and special callings; but surely the
strange and unusual seemed to be reached when in the early days of
our undertaking the Engineering Division of the Ordnance Department
sought the services of expert armorers.</p>

<p>Through the advice of the National Research Council, which had
established a committee of armor experts, the Ordnance Department
commissioned in its service Maj. Bashford Dean, a life-long specialist
in armor, curator in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an institution
which, learning of the Government's need, at once placed at its disposal
its wonderful specimens of authentic armor, its armor repair
shop where models could at once be made, and the services of Maj.
Dean's assistant there whom he had brought from France, Daniel
Tachaux, one of the few surviving armorers, who had inherited
lineally the technical side of the ancient craft.</p>

<p>It may be said that there were but two nations in the great war
which went to the Middle Ages for ideas as to protective armor&mdash;ourselves
and Germany. The Germans, who applied science to
almost every phase of warfare, did not neglect it here. Germany
at the start consulted her experts on ancient armor and worked
along lines which they suggested. The German helmet used in the
trenches was undoubtedly superior to any other helmet given a
practical use.</p>

<p>The first helmets to be used in the great war were of French manufacture.
They were designed by Gen. Adrien, and 2,000,000 of them
were manufactured and issued to the French Army. These helmets
were the product of hasty pioneer work, but the fact that they
saved from 2 to 5 per cent of the normal casualties of such a war as
was being fought at once impelled the other belligerents to adopt
the idea. Great Britain, spurred by the necessity of producing
quickly a helmet in quantity, designed the most simple helmet to
manufacture, which could be pressed out of cold metal.</p>

<p>When America entered the war she had, naturally, no distinctive
helmet; and the English type, being easiest to make, was adopted to
fill the gap until we could design a more efficient one ourselves.
Consequently 400,000 British helmets were bought in England and
issued to the vanguard of the American Expeditionary Forces. Our
men wore them, became accustomed to them, and came to feel that
they were the badge of English-speaking troops. The British helmet
thus became a habit with our men, one difficult to change, a fact
which mitigated against the popularity of the more advanced and
scientific models which we were to bring out.</p>

<p>Now, the British helmet possessed some notable defects. It did
not afford a maximum of protective area. The center of gravity
was not so placed as to keep the helmet from wobbling. The lining
was uncomfortable and disregarded the anatomy of the head. It
was vulnerable at the concave surface where bowl and brim joined.</p>

<p>It is not an astonishing circumstance that some of the earlier helmets
worn by the men-at-arms of the days of knighthood possessed certain
of these same defects, notably, that they were apt to be top-heavy
and uncomfortable. Only by centuries of constant application and
improvement were the armorers of the Middle Ages able to produce
helmets which overcame these defects and which embodied all of the
principles of defense and strength which science could put into
them. The best medieval helmets stand at the summit of the art.
It was the constant aim of the modern specialist, aided by the
facilities of the twentieth century industries, to produce helmets as
perfect technically as those rare models which are the pride of
museums and collectors.</p>

<p>Certainly in one respect we had the advantage of the ancients in
that we have nowadays at our disposal the modern alloy-steels of
great resistance. An alloy of this kind having a thickness of 0.036
of an inch is able to stop at a distance of 10 feet a jacketed, automatic
pistol ball, .45 caliber, traveling at the rate of 600 feet a
second. This was important not only from the standpoint of helmet
production, but from the further inference that body armor of such
steel might still be profitably used. The records of the hospitals in
France show that 7 or 8 of every 10 wounded soldiers were wounded
by fragments of shell and other missiles which even thin armor plate
would have kept out. The German troops used body armor in large
numbers, each set weighing from 19 to 24 pounds. In this country
we believed it possible to produce body armor which would not be
difficult to carry and which would resist the impact of a machine-gun
bullet at fairly close range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>The production of helmets, however, was our first concern; and
in order to be sure of a sufficient quantity of these protective headpieces,
we adopted the British model for production in the United
States and went ahead with it on a large scale. For the metal we
adopted after much experimentation a steel alloy with a high percentage
of manganese. This was practically the same as the steel of
the British helmet. Its chief advantage was that it was easy to
work in the metal presses in existence and it required no further
tempering after leaving the stamping presses. Its hardness, however,
wore away the stamping tools much more quickly than ordinary
steel sheets would do.</p>

<p>While we adopted the British helmet in design and substantially
in metal used, we originated our own helmet lining. The lining was
woven of cotton twine in meshes three-eighths of an inch square.
This web, fitting tightly upon the wearer's head, evenly distributed the
weight of the two-pound helmet, and in the same way distributed the
force of any blow upon the helmet. The netting, together with small
pieces of rubber around the edge of the lining, kept the helmet away
from the head, so that even a relatively large dent could not reach
the wearer's skull.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the linings for the American helmets
were produced by concerns whose ordinary business was the manufacture
of shoes. There were 10 of these companies taking such contracts.
Steel for the helmet was rolled by the American Sheet &amp;
Tin Plate Co. The helmets were pressed and stamped into shape by
seven companies which had done similar work before the war. These
concerns were:</p>

<p>The metal helmets and the woven linings were delivered to the
plant of the Ford Motor Co. at Philadelphia, where they were painted
and assembled. The helmets were painted in the olive-drab shade
for protective coloring. While on dull days such objects could not
be discerned at a great distance, in bright weather their rounded surfaces
might catch and reflect sunbeams, thus betraying the positions
of their wearers. To guard against this, as soon as the helmets were
treated to a first coat of paint fine sawdust was blown upon the wet
surface. When this had dried, another coat of paint was applied,
and a nonreflective, gritty surface was thus produced.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>We began receiving substantial quantities of finished helmets by
the end of November of the first year of the war. On February 17,
1918, practically 700,000 had been shipped abroad or were ready for
shipment at the ports of embarkation. Later in the spring of 1918,
when we began sending men to France much beyond our earlier
expectations, the orders for helmets were greatly expanded. In July
the total orders reached 3,000,000, in August 6,000,000, and in September
7,000,000. This would give us enough to meet all requirements
until June, 1919.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed the factories were producing more
than 100,000 helmets every four days, and were rapidly approaching
the time when their daily output would be 60,000. The Government
canceled all helmet contracts as soon as the fighting ceased, having
received up to that time a total of 2,700,000 of them.</p>

<p>While this manufacture was going on we were developing helmets
of our own. Major Dean went to France to collect information
dealing with the actual needs of the service and to present numerous
experimental models of helmets for the comment and criticism of the
General Staff. In numerous cases these models were accepted for
manufacture here in experimental lots.</p>

<p>In all we developed four models which seemed to have merits recommending
their adoption. The first distinctive American helmet was
known as model No. 2. The Ford Co. at Detroit pressed about 1,200
of these helmets. The helmet, however, was similar in appearance
to the German helmet, and for that reason was disapproved by the
American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>Helmet model No. 3 was of a deep-bowl type, but it was rejected
when the Hale &amp; Kilburn Co., of Philadelphia, after a great deal of
experimentation, found that the helmet was too deep for successful
manufacture by pressing.</p>

<p>Model No. 4 was designed by the master armorer of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. It was also found too difficult to manufacture.</p>

<p>Helmet No. 5 was strongly recommended by American experts, but
was not accepted by the General Staff. It was designed by the armor
committee at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in conjunction with the
Engineering Division of the Ordnance Department. Hale &amp; Kilburn
undertook to manufacture these helmets, which were to be painted,
assembled, and packed by the Ford Motor Co. at its Philadelphia
plant. Various component parts of the helmet were sublet in experimental
quantities to numerous manufacturers.</p>

<p>The No. 5 helmet, complete, weighed 2 pounds, 6&frac12; ounces. It
combined the virtues of several types of helmets. It gave a maximum
of protection for its weight. It was comparatively easy to
produce. This helmet, with slight variations, was later adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
as the standard helmet of the Swiss Army. The latest German
helmet, it is interesting to note, was approaching similar lines.</p>

<p>We also produced helmets for special services&mdash;one with a visor
to protect machine gunners and snipers, and another, known as
model 14, for aviators, it being little heavier than the leather helmet
which airmen wore in the war and twenty times as strong a defense
for the head. A third special helmet, known as model 15, was for
operators of tanks. It was provided with a neck guard of padded
silk to stop the lead splash which penetrated the turret of the tank.
The Ordnance Department turned out 25 of these in 10 days and sent
them by courier to France for a test.</p>

<p>The Germans issued body armor only to troops holding exposed
positions under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire; but such use was
distinctly valuable, as was shown by captured German reports.</p>

<p>The Engineering Division of the Ordnance Department developed
a body defense including a light front and body plate, these
together weighing 9&frac12; pounds. One lot of 5,000 sets was manufactured
by the Hale &amp; Kilburn Corporation. The linings of these
plates were of sponge rubber, and they were made by the Miller
Rubber Co., of Akron, Ohio. All of these sets were shipped abroad
for testing; but the report was not favorable, as the American soldier
did not wish to be hampered with armor. He had learned to
wear his helmet, but he had yet to be convinced of the practical value
of body armor.</p>

<p>We developed a heavy breast plate with thigh guards, weighing
27 pounds, which stopped machine gun bullets at 150 yards. An
experimental lot of these were completed in 26 days by the Mullins
Manufacturing Co., of Salem, Ohio. These were also shipped
abroad for test.</p>

<p>A few defenses for arms and legs were prepared which, although
light in weight, would protect the wearer from an automatic-pistol
ball at 10 feet. About 70 per cent of the hospital cases in France were
casualties caused by wounds in the arms and legs. These defenses,
however, were rejected on account of their impeding to a certain
degree the movements of the wearer.</p>

<p>Our development in armor also produced an aviator's chair weighing
60 pounds. It would protect the pilot from injury from below
and from the back, withstanding armor-piercing bullets fired at a
distance of 50 yards. Since the piercing of the gas mask canister
by a bullet might result in the death of the soldier by admitting gas
directly into the breathing system of his mask, the Ordnance Department
designed an armored haversack for the gas mask and its canister,
this haversack incidentally serving as a breast defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>


<h4>BAYONETS AND TRENCH KNIVES.</h4>

<p>Another large ordnance operation was the production of bayonets
for the service rifles. The British bayonet had proved to be highly
satisfactory in the war; and, since it was already designed to fit the
Enfield rifle, which we had adopted for our own, we took the British
bayonet as it was and, with only one slight alteration, set out to
produce it in this country.</p>

<p>The Government found both the Remington Arms-Union Metallic
Cartridge Co. at its Bridgeport, Conn., works, and the Winchester
Repeating Arms Co. building these bayonets for the English Government.
The latter's bayonet needs by 1917 were being well supplied
by home manufacture, and this permitted us to buy approximately
545,500 bayonets which had already been manufactured
for the British.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department at once started out these two concerns
on contracts for bayonets for the American Government, Remington
with total orders for 2,820,803 bayonets and Winchester with orders
for 672,500. Remington delivered in all 1,565,644 bayonets and
Winchester 395,894. This was a total of 1,961,500 bayonets.</p>

<p>The total production of 1917 rifles was about 2,520,000. These
figures indicate that we were short over 500,000 bayonets at the
time hostilities ceased; and as a matter of fact this shortage had
already become acute, especially in the training camps.</p>

<p>The bayonets had not come as rapidly as we had expected, because
to produce them at the rate originally planned would have interfered
with the more essential production of rifles by these same companies.
Accordingly in 1918 additional contracts for bayonets were made.
Landers, Frary &amp; Clark, of New Britain, Conn., engaged to manufacture
500,000 bayonets, and the National Motor Vehicle Co.,
255,000. These latter contracts, however, were suspended after the
armistice was signed. The additional orders had made it certain
that there would be no bayonet shortage by the spring of 1919.</p>

<p>While this production was under way we were also manufacturing
bayonets for the model 1903 Springfield rifle. The Springfield
Armory produced 347,533 of these and the Rock Island Arsenal
36,800. In addition the Springfield Armory delivered 50,000 bayonet
blades as spare parts.</p>

<p>We not only had to provide bayonets but also the scabbards
to hold them in. The scabbard of the 1917 bayonet was of simple
manufacture and there were no difficulties in securing sufficient
quantities. The Jewell Belt Co. delivered 1,810,675 of them; Graton
&amp; Knight delivered 1,669,581; while the Rock Island Arsenal produced
3,000. This gave us a total of 3,480,000 scabbards, a quantity
greatly in excess of the production of either bayonets or rifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>A new weapon which had come into use during the great war as
part of the soldier's individual equipment was the trench knife. The
question of making such knives was taken up by the Government
with various manufacturers throughout the country and they were
given a general idea of what was required and, in conjunction
with the Ordnance Department, were requested to develop details.
The design submitted by Henry Disston &amp; Sons, of Philadelphia,
received the most favorable consideration. This knife was manufactured
and known as model 1917. It was a triangular blade
9 inches long. The triangular blade was deemed the most efficient
because of the ease with which it would pierce clothing and even
leather. This knife was slightly changed as regards handle and given
a different guard to protect the man's knuckles, and was known as
model 1918. These knives were sent abroad in large quantities to
be used by the American Expeditionary Forces. Landers, Frary &amp;
Clark produced 113,000 of these knives and the Oneida Community
(Ltd.), Oneida, N. Y., 10,000.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces made an
exhaustive test, comparing the various trench knives used abroad.
The four knives tested were as follows; United States, model 1917;
Hughes; French; and British knuckle knife. These tests were made
to determine the merits of the different knives as to the following
points:</p>


<ul class="index"><li>(<i>a</i>) Serviceability&mdash;ability to carry in hand and function other arms.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Quickness in action.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) If the soldier were knocked unconscious, would knife drop from hand?</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Suitability to carry in hand when crawling.</li>

<li>(<i>e</i>) Probability of being knocked out of hand.</li>

<li>(<i>f</i>) Weight, length, shape of blade.</li>

<li>(<i>g</i>) Shape of handle.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was found that the model 1917, although a satisfactory knife,
could be improved. Therefore the trench knife known as Mark I
was developed partially by the American Expeditionary Forces and
partially by the Engineering Division of Ordnance. This knife was
entirely different from the model 1917, having a flat blade, metal
scabbard, and a cast-bronze handle. It was a combination of all
the good points of all the knives used by the foreign armies.</p>

<p>The Government placed orders for 1,232,780 of the new knives.
Deliveries were to have begun in December, but before that time
peace had come and the orders had been reduced to 119,424. The
new model knives were to have been manufactured by A. A. Simons
&amp; Son, Dayton, Ohio; Henry Disston &amp; Son, Philadelphia; Landers,
Frary &amp; Clark, and the Oneida Community (Ltd.). All contracts
were canceled except the one with Landers, Frary &amp; Clark.</p>

<h4>PERISCOPES, BELTS, ETC.</h4>

<p>Another new article in the equipment of our soldiers was the
trench periscope, a device enabling a man to look over the edge of
the trench without exposing himself to fire. The ordinary periscope
was merely a wooden box 2 inches square and 15 inches long, with
an inclined mirror set at each end. Production was commenced in
October, 1917, by two companies, and 81,000 were delivered by the
middle of January. In August, 1918, an additional lot of 60,000
was ordered, but the deliveries of these were slow.</p>

<p>An even simpler periscope was merely a mirror about three inches
long and an inch and a half wide which could be placed on a bayonet
or a stick and set up over the trench so that it gave a view of the
ground in front. A total of 100,000 of these was delivered before
the end of July, 1918, and 50,000 additional ones before November.
Further facts about periscopes are set down in the chapter in this
report relating to sights and fire-control apparatus.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war all textile equipment, such as cartridge
belts, bandoleers to carry ammunition, haversacks, pack carriers,
pistol holsters, canteen covers and similar material were supplied in
woven material. Only two concerns in this country could manufacture
articles of this quality. They were the Mills Woven Cartridge
Belt Co., Worcester, Mass., and the Russell Manufacturing Co.,
Middletown, Conn. Although these two concerns practically doubled
their output and worked day and night to supply the material, the
demand was too great, and belts and carriers were designed to be
stitched and sewn and not woven. Equipment made in this manner
is inferior to the woven article. However, the Mills Woven Cartridge
Belt Co. produced approximately 3,200,000 of these articles and the
Russell Manufacturing Co., 1,500,000. Large producers of the
stitched and sewn material were the Plant Brothers Co., Boston,
Mass.; R. H. Long Co., Framingham, Mass.; L. C. Chase Co., Watertown,
Mass.</p>

<p>For the Browning automatic rifle and the Browning machine gun
there were specially designed belts and bandoleers. The rifleman had
his own special belt, and his first and second assistants had their own
individual belts, and the assistants also had two bandoleers each, one
right and one left, which were carried across their shoulders. These
were manufactured in quantities by the following manufacturers:</p>

    <td>20,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Many small articles of textile equipment were produced in immense
quantities. There were approximately four and a half million
canteen covers produced prior to November 1. Large contracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
were placed with the following concerns: Perkins-Campbell Co., Cincinnati,
Ohio; Brauer Bros., St. Louis, Mo.; L. C. Chase Co., Watertown,
Mass.; Miller-Hexter Co., Cleveland, Ohio; Powers Manufacturing
Co., Waterloo, Iowa; R. H. Long Co., Framingham, Mass.;
Bradford Co., St. Joseph, Mich.; Galvin Bros., Cleveland, Ohio;
Progressive Knitting Works, Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>

<p>Approximately four and a half million haversacks were produced
and delivered prior to November 1, 1918. Large manufacturers
producing these were as follows: Canvas Products Co., St. Louis, Mo.;
Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Ill.; Plant Bros., Boston, Mass.;
Simmons Hardware Co., St. Louis, Mo.; R. H. Long Co., Framingham,
Mass.; Liberty, Durgin (Inc.), Haverhill, Mass.; Wiley, Bickford
&amp; Sweet, Hartford, Conn.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to enumerate the entire range of ordnance
munitions produced, outside of the development of guns and their
ammunition; but their manufacture, in orders that ordinarily
amounted to the millions of individual pieces, engaged the activities
of a large number of manufacturers of the United States.</p>

<p>The Government ordered about 1,200,000 axes to be used in trench
operations, of which 661,690 were delivered. Bags of all sorts for
horse feed, grain, rations, and supplies totaled in their deliveries
about 2,250,000. The Government received 809,541 saddle blankets;
about 3,750,000 carriers for entrenching shovels, axes, and picks;
nearly 4,450,000 covers for the breech locks of rifles; over 1,000,000
currycombs; 76,230 lariats; 727,000 entrenching picks; nearly
4,750,000 first-aid pouches, and over 2,000,000 pouches for small
articles; 234,689 Cavalry saddles; 134,092 Field Artillery saddles;
15,287 mule saddles; 482,459 saddle bags; nearly 1,800,000 entrenching
shovels; 2,843,092 spur straps; 70,556 steel measuring tapes
each 5 feet long.</p>

<p>These figures selected at random from thousands of miscellaneous
items indicate to some extent the scale on which America went into
the war.</p>

<p>The old model 1910 American wire cutter, although efficient in
times past, was not capable of cutting specially constructed manganese
wire which the Germans used. Therefore it became necessary for
this country to develop a better cutter. A meeting of the plier
manufacturers of the country was called and the question was put
before them. The spirit of cooperation of the American manufacturers
was evident, inasmuch as over 90 per cent of the manufacturers
attended the meeting.</p>

<p>The model submitted by Kraeuter &amp; Co., Newark, N. J., was
adopted and 5,000 were manufactured and sent to France. Although
this was the best cutter developed in this short time, it was evident
that it was not the right article, and the Engineering Division of
Ordnance continued experimenting to make a more satisfactory one.
In this connection a one-hand wire cutter was developed by the
William Schollhorn Co., of New Haven, Conn. This cutter was a
very efficient and satisfactory article, and, although it was never
adopted by the American Army during the war, it is worthy of consideration.
The American Expeditionary Forces eventually sent
back drawings and sample of the French wire cutter, which was
developed abroad and known as model 1918. This was a large,
two-handed cutter. Production was started. The article was
found difficult to manufacture, but the manufacturers undertook it
with a will and production was well under way when the armistice
was signed.</p>

<p>The mess equipment of the soldier included the following items:
meat can, condiment can, canteen and cup, knife, fork, and spoon.
These articles were practically the same as the Army had always
used, with one exception&mdash;the meat can. Advice was received from
the American Expeditionary Forces that the meat cans in which the
soldiers' food was placed by the cooks of the various organizations
were not large enough to hold the portions that the American doughboys
needed when they were fighting at the front. Although production
was well under way with various American manufacturers
on the old model, a new model can was designed which was half an
inch deeper. The American manufacturers immediately, with a
great deal of trouble to themselves, changed their dies and tools and
manufactured a new meat can which was larger than the old.
Thousands of cans were turned out daily.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

THE AIRCRAFT PROBLEM.</h3>


<p>When the United States entered the war against Germany in 1917
there was no phase of her forthcoming industrial effort from which so
much was expected as from the building of airplanes and equipment
for aerial warfare; yet there was no phase of the immense undertaking
in which the United States was so utterly unprepared. In many
other branches of the work of providing mat&eacute;riel for a modern army,
however inadequately acquainted America might be with the developments
which had gone on in Europe since 1914, yet she had splendid
resources of skill and equipment which could quickly turn from the
pursuits of peace to the arts attending warfare. But there was no
large existing industry in the United States which could turn easily
to the production of airplanes, since such airplanes as were known
in Europe in 1917 had never been built in the United States.</p>

<p>It seems difficult now for us to realize how utterly unlearned we
were, both in official and technical quarters, in the design, the production,
or the use of aeronautical equipment in those early days of
1917. Here in America mechanical flight had been born; but we
had lived to see other nations develop the invention into an industry
and a science that was a closed book to our people. In the three
years of warfare before American participation, the airplane had been
forced through a whole generation of normal mechanical evolution.
Of this progress we were aware only as nontechnical and distant
observers. Such military study of the progress as we had conducted
was casual. It had, in fact, brought to America scarcely a single
basic fact on which we could build our contemplated industry.</p>

<p>When the United States became a belligerent no American-built
airplane had ever mounted a machine gun or carried any other than
the simplest of necessary instruments. Such things as oxygen apparatus,
electrically heated clothing for aviators, radio-communication
with airplanes, landing and bombing flares, electric lighting
systems for planes, bomb-dropping devices, suitable compasses,
instruments for measuring height and speed, and the like&mdash;in short,
all the modern paraphernalia that completes the efficiency of combat
airplanes&mdash;these were almost entirely unknown to us.</p>

<p>The best of the prewar activities of America in this line had
produced some useful airplane engines and a few planes which the
countries then at war were willing to use only in training of aviators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the Army itself there was small nucleus of skill around
which could be built an organization expert and sophisticated. We
had in the official files no adequate information as to sizes, capacities,
and types of planes or engines, or character of ordnance, armament, or
aeronautical appliances demanded by the exacting service in which
our young birdmen were soon to engage. Even the airplanes on
order in April, 1917 (over 350 of them), proved to be of such antiquated
design that the manufacturers of them, in the light of their
increased knowledge of war requirements a few months later, asked
to be released from their contracts.</p>

<p>Nor was there in the United States any industry so closely allied
to airplane manufacture that its engineers and designers could turn
from one to the other and take their places at once abreast of the
progress in Europe. There was little or no engineering talent in the
United States competent to design fully equipped military aircraft
which could compete with Europe. Our aircraft producers must
first go to France and England and Italy, and ground themselves
in the principles of a new science before they could attempt to produce
their own designs or even before they could be safe in selecting
European designs for reproduction in this country.</p>

<p>The first consideration of the whole program by the Joint Army
and Navy Technical Board indicated a figure of 22,000 as the number
of airplanes, including both training and battle types, which should
be furnished for the use of the Army during the 12 months following
July 1, 1917. This figure represented the determination of America
to play a major part in aerial warfare. It was not possible for the
board to realize at that time all of the problems which would be
encountered, and the figures indicated confidence in the ability of the
industrial organizations of the United States to meet a difficult situation,
rather than an exact plan under which such production might
be developed.</p>

<p>It is probable that it was not fully realized that the production of
this program, with the proper proportion of spare parts required for
military operations, meant the manufacture of the equivalent of about
40,000 airplanes.</p>

<p>Without an industry then, and with little knowledge or understanding
of the problems of military aerial equipment, we faced the
task of securing the equivalent of 40,000 airplanes in 12 brief months
beginning July, 1917.</p>

<p>In one respect we were in a degree prepared in professional skill
and mechanical equipment to go ahead on broad lines. This was in
the matter of producing engines. The production of aviation engines
in America had, indeed, been comparatively slight, but in the automobile
industry had been developed a vast engine-building capacity.
The detail equipment of automobile shops was not entirely suited to
aviation engines, but, nevertheless, it furnished the basis for the
future successful production of the Liberty engine and the other
engines called for by the air program.</p>

<p>America succeeded, once the requirements were known, in producing
the various accessories of aerial warfare. It was necessary first to
learn from foreign sources what these accessories were and how they
should be built; but as a rule it was possible to adapt American
production resources to the problem, and the difficulties experienced
were rather those of determining requirements and the exact adaptation
of the various articles to specific airplanes.</p>

<p>The achievements of America in aircraft production during the
war period may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>In our 19 months of warfare we outdid any one of the belligerent
nations in Europe in the production of airplanes in its first 19 months
of intensive production. In our second year of war we nearly equaled
the record of England in her third.</p>

<p>At the end of the effort, after our designers had saturated themselves
in the science and were abreast of the developments of Europe,
they produced several typical American airplanes which gave promise
of being superior to any that Europe was turning out.</p>

<p>We created one of the three or four best airplane engines, if not the
best of all, that the world had seen, and produced it in great quantities.
We took a standard but complicated aero-engine from Europe
and not only duplicated it in quantity here but turned out a finer
product than the original French makers had been able to obtain with
their careful and more leisurely methods.</p>

<p>In the steel cylinders of all the aero-engines we built was a capacity
for producing some seven or eight million horsepower, an energy
equivalent to one-fifth of the commercially practicable water power
of the United States. The Liberty engines built could alone do the
work of the entire flood of Niagara and have a million horsepower to
spare.</p>

<p>In three years of warfare the allies had been able to develop only a
single machine gun that could be successfully synchronized to fire
through a revolving airplane propeller. In 12 months of actual effort
America produced two others as good, both susceptible of factory
quantity production.</p>

<p>We developed new airplane cameras. We carried to new stages
the science of clothing aviators. We developed in quantity the wireless
airplane telephone that stilled in the ears of the pilot the bedlam
of wind and machine guns and engine exhaust and placed him within
easy speaking radius of his ground station and his commander in
the air.</p>

<p>We built balloons at a rate to supply more than our own needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>When the shortage of linen threatened the entire airplane output
of the nations opposing Germany, we developed cotton wing fabric
that not only substituted for linen, but proved to be better; and in
producing a liquid filler to make this fabric wind-tight we established
on a large scale an entirely new chemical industry in the United
States.</p>

<p>Such were the high points in the history of America's aircraft production
for war. The details of the developments which led to
these results are set forth on the following pages.</p>

<p>Sketchy and incomplete as was our knowledge of airplane construction
in the early days of 1917, it was no more hazy than our
notion of how many planes to build. What would constitute
overwhelming superiority in the air?</p>

<p>As an indication of the rapidity with which history has moved, it
may be stated that in January and February of 1917 the Signal Corps
discussed the feasibility of building 1,000 planes in a year of construction.
This seems now to us a ridiculously low figure to propose
as representative of American resources, but in the early weeks of
1917 the construction of a thousand airplanes appeared to be a formidable
undertaking. In March, when war was inevitable, we raised
this number to 2,500 planes within 12 months; in April, when war
was declared, we raised it again to 3,700.</p>

<p>But once we were in the war, through the exchange of military
missions our designers were taken into the confidence of the aviation
branches of the French, British, and Italian Armies and shown then
for the first time a comprehensive view of the development of the
war plane, both what had been done in the past and what might be
expected in the future. As a result our Joint Army and Navy
Technical Board in the last week of May and the early part of June,
1917, recommended to the Secretaries of War and the Navy that a
building program be started at once to produce the stupendous total
of 19,775 planes for our own use and 3,000 additional ones, if we were
to train foreign aviators, or approximately 22,000 in all. This was a
program worthy of America's industrial greatness. Of these proposed
planes, 7,050 were for training our flyers, 725 for the defense
of the United States and insular possessions, and 12,000 for active
service in France.</p>

<p>Such was the task assigned to an industry that in the previous 12
months had manufactured less than 800 airplanes, and those consisting
principally of training planes for foreign governments.</p>

<p>The expanding national ambition for an aircraft industry was also
shown by the mounting money grants. On May 12 Congress voted
$10,800,000 for military aeronautics. On June 15 an appropriation
of $43,450,000 was voted for the same purpose. Finally on July 24,
1917, the President signed the bill appropriating $640,000,000 for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
aircraft. This was the largest appropriation ever made by Congress
for one specific purpose, and this bill was put through both Houses
within the period of a little more than a week.</p>

<p>The figure 22,000, however, scarcely indicates the size of this undertaking,
as we were to realize before long. We little understood the
infinite complications of fully equipping battle planes. Lacking that
invaluable experience which Europe had attained in three years of
production, we had no practical realization of the fact that for each
100 airplanes an equivalent of 80 additional airplanes must be provided
in spare parts. In other words, an effective fighting plane delivered
in France is not one plane, but it is one plane and eight-tenths
of another; which means that the program adopted in June, 1917,
called for the production in 12 months of not 22,000 airplanes but
rather the equivalent of 40,000 airplanes.</p>

<p>Let us set down the inventory of the Government's own resources
for handling this project.</p>

<p>The American Air Service, which was then part of the Signal Corps,
had had a struggling and meager existence, working with the old
pusher type of planes until in 1914 an appropriation of $250,000 was
made available for the purchase of new airplanes and equipment.
Shortly after this appropriation was granted, five officers were sent to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a course in aeronautics.
When the war broke out in Europe in August, 1914, these men constituted
the entire technically trained personnel of the Air Service of the
United States. By April 6, 1917, we had 65 officers in the Air Service,
an enlisted and civilian personnel of 1,330, two flying fields, and a
few serviceable planes of the training type.</p>

<p>This equipment may be compared with that of Germany, France,
and England at the time they went to war. Germany is believed to
have had nearly 1,000 airplanes in August, 1914; France had about
300; and England barely 250. America's 224, delivered up to April
6, 1917, were nearly all obsolete in type when compared with the
machines then in effective service in France.</p>

<p>No sooner had the United States embarked upon the war than the
agents of the European manufacturers of airplanes descended upon the
Aircraft Board in swarms. France and Italy had both adopted the
policy of depending upon the private development of designs for their
supplies of airplanes, with the result that the builders of each country
had produced a number of successful types of flying machines and an
even greater number of types of engines. On the assumption that
the United States would adopt certain of these types and build them
here, the agents for the Sopwiths, the Capronis, the Handley-Pages,
and many others proceeded to demonstrate the particular excellences
of their various articles. Out of this confusion of counsel stood one
pertinent fact in relief&mdash;the United States would have to pay considerable
royalties for the use of any of these European devices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the relative merits of types and designs, it was soon apparent
that no intelligent decision could be reached in Washington or anywhere
but in Europe. Because of our distance from the front and the
length of time required to put the American industrial machine into
operation on a large scale, it was necessary that in advance we understand
types and tendencies in aircraft construction, so that we might
anticipate aircraft development in such special designs as we might
adopt. Otherwise, if we accepted the types of equipment then in use
in Europe, by the time we had begun producing on a large scale a year
or so later we would find our output obsolete and out of date, so
rapidly was the aircraft art moving.</p>

<p>Consequently, in June the United States sent to Europe a commission
of six civilian and military experts, headed by Maj. R. C. Bolling,
part of whose duties was to advise the American War Department as
to what types of planes and engines and other air equipment we should
prepare to manufacture. Also, in April the Chief of the Signal Corps
had cables sent to England, France, and Italy, requesting that aviation
experts be sent at once to this country; and shortly after this
we dispatched to Europe more than 100 skilled mechanics to work in
the foreign engine and airplane plants and acquire the training that
would make them the nucleus of a large mechanical force for aircraft
production in this country.</p>

<p>But while these early educational activities were in progress, much
could be done at home that need not await the forthcoming reports
from the Bolling mission. We had, for instance, in this country several
types of planes and engines that would be suitable for the training
fields which were even then being established. The Signal Corps,
therefore, bent its energies upon the manufacture of training equipment,
leaving the development of battle aircraft to come after we
should know more about that subject.</p>

<p>It was evident that we could not equip an airplane industry and
furnish machines to our fliers abroad before the summer of 1918; and
so we arranged with France for this equipment by placing orders with
French factories for 5,875 planes of regular French design. These
were all to be delivered by July 1, 1918.</p>

<p>In the arrangement with the French factories we agreed to supply
from the United States a great deal of the raw materials for these
machines, and the contract for furnishing these supplies was given to
J. G. White &amp; Co. of New York City. This concern did a creditable
job, shipping about 5,000,000 feet of lumber, much necessary machinery,
and a multitude of items required in the fabrication of airplanes,
all to the value of $10,000,000.</p>

<p>The total weight of the shipments on this contract was something
like 23,000 tons, this figure including 7,500 tons of lumber. The
other tonnage consisted of tubing of steel, brass, copper and alumi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>num;
sheets of steel, copper, lead, and aluminum; as well as bar
steel, tool steel, structural steel, ball bearings, crank shafts, turnbuckles,
radiator tubes, wire, cable, bolts, nuts, screws, nails, fiber
cloth, felt, and rubber. All of this was in addition to approximately
1,000 machine tools, such as motors, lathes, and grinders.</p>

<p>The orders for French planes were divided as follows: 725 Nieuport
training planes, 150 Spad training planes, 1,500 Breguet service
planes; 2,000 Spad service planes; and 1,500 New Spad or Nieuport
service planes. The decision between the New Spad or Nieuport
service planes was to be made as soon as the New Spad could be
tested. These planes were to be delivered in specified monthly
quantities increasing in number until the total of 1,360 planes should
be placed in our hands during the month of March, 1918, alone. The
contracts were to be concluded in June with the delivery of the final
1,115 planes. We also contracted for the manufacture of 8,500
service engines of the Renault, Hispano and Gnome makes, all of
these to be delivered by the end of June.</p>

<p>When the armistice ended the fighting, we had produced a total of
11,754 airplanes in America, together with most of the necessary
spare parts for about one-third of them.</p>

<p>While a large part of the American airplanes built in the war
period were of the training type rather than the service, or battle,
type, nevertheless it was necessary that we have a large equipment
of training planes in order to prepare the swiftly expanding personnel
of the Air Service for its future activity at the front. The
nations associated with us in the war, however, had produced their
training equipment prior to our participation as a belligerent, and
at the time we entered the war the French, British, and Italians
were producing only enough training planes to maintain their training
equipment and were going in heavily with the rest of their airplane
industries for the production of service planes.</p>

<p>With these considerations in mind, the reader may make an
interesting comparison of British and American plane production,
the British figures being for both the British Army and the British
Navy, whereas the American figures are for the American Army
alone. In the following table of comparison the British figures
are based on the Lockhart Report of November 1, 1918:</p>

<p>Broadly stated, and without reference to types of planes produced,
these figures mean that the United States in her second year of the
war produced for the American Army alone almost as many airplanes
as Great Britain in her third year of the war built for both her army
and navy. In October, 1918, factories in this country turned out
1,651 planes, which, without allowing for the monthly expansion
in the production, was at the rate of 20,000 planes per year. Assuming
no increase in the October rate of production, we would have
attained the 22,000 airplanes in 23 months after July 1, 1917, the
date on which the production effort may be said to have started.
Our production of fighting planes in the war period was 3,328.</p>

<p>On the day the armistice was signed we had received from all
sources 16,952 planes. Of these 5,198 had been produced for us by
the allies. We had 48 flying fields, 20,568 Air Service officers, and
174,456 enlisted men and civilian personnel. These figures do not
mean that we had more than 17,000 planes on hand at that time,
because the mortality in airplanes is high from accidents and ordinary
wear and tear.</p>


<h4>THE PROBLEM OF MATERIAL.</h4>

<p>Once we had started out on this enterprise we soon discovered that
the production of airplanes was something more than a mere manufacturing
job. With almost any other article we might have made
our designs, given orders to the factories, and rested in the security
that in due time the articles would be forthcoming. But with airplanes
we had to create the industry; and this meant not only the
equipping of factories, but the procurement and sometimes the actual
production of the raw materials.</p>

<p>For instance, the ideal lubricant for the airplane motor is castor oil.
When we discovered that the supply of castor oil was not nearly sufficient
for our future needs, the Government itself secured from Asia
a large quantity of castor beans, enough to seed more than 100,000
acres in this country and thus to provide for the future lubrication for
our motors. This actual creation of raw materials was conducted on
a much larger scale in the cases of certain other commodities used in
airplane construction, particularly in the production of lumber and
cotton and in the manufacture of the chemicals for the "dope" with
which the airplane wings are covered and made air-tight.</p>

<p>An airplane must have wings and an engine with a propeller to
make it go; and, like a bird, it must have a tail to make it fly straight
and a body (fuselage) to hold all together. Part of the tail (the
rudder) moves sideways and steers the airplane from left to right;
part moves up and down (the elevators) and makes the airplane go
up or down, and parts of the wings (the ailerons) move up and down
and make the airplane tip from side to side. All of these things must
be connected to the controls in the hands of the pilot. The front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
edges of the wings are raised above the line of flight; and when the
propeller driven by the engine forces the wings through the air, the
airplane is lifted and flies.</p>

<p>All of the airplanes built for the United States during the war were
tractor biplanes. In a plane of the tractor type the propeller is in
front and pulls the machine. The biplane is so called because it has
two planes or wings, one above the other. The biplane has been the
most largely used of all types in war for two reasons: first, the struts
and wires between the planes form a truss structure, and this gives
the needed strength; and second, there is less danger of enemy bullets
wrecking a biplane in the air because its wing support is greater
than that of the monoplane or single-winged machine.</p>

<p>Since the airplane can lift only a limited weight, every part of the
mechanism must be as light as possible. An airplane engine weighs
from 2 to 3 pounds per horsepower, whereas an automobile motor
weighs from 8 to 10 pounds per horsepower. The skeleton of the
airplane is made of wood, mostly spruce, with sheet-steel fittings to
join the wood parts together, and steel wires and rods to make
every part a truss. This skeleton is covered with cloth, and the
cloth is stretched and made smooth by dope.</p>

<p>Wood, sheet steel, wire, cloth, varnish&mdash;these are the principal
components of an airplane. As raw materials they all seem easy to
obtain in America. And so they are in peace times and for ordinary
purposes. But never before had quality been so essential in an
American industry, from the raw material up to the finished product&mdash;quality
in the materials used, and quality in the workmanship
which fashions the parts. But combined with this quality we were
forced to produce in quantities, bounded only by our own physical
limitations, and these quantities must include not only the materials
for our own air program but also some of the principal raw materials
used by the airplane builders in France and England, specifically, all
of the spruce which the allies would require and, later, much of the
wing fabric and dope for their machines.</p>

<p>Quite early it was apparent to us that we had on our hands a
problem in spruce production which the Government itself must
solve, if the airplane undertaking were not to fail at the outset.
When we entered the war linen was exclusively used for the covering
of wings; and it developed almost immediately that the United
Kingdom was practically the sole source of linen. But the Irish
looms could not begin to furnish us with our needs for this commodity.
Later on came up the question of supplying dope and castor oil.
Finally, during the last months of the war, it became necessary for
us to follow up the production of all classes of our raw material,
particularly in working out a suitable supply of steel tubing. But
our great creative efforts in raw materials were confined to spruce,
fabric, and dope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The lumber problem involved vast questions of an industrial and
technical character. We had to conduct a campaign of education in
the knowledge of aircraft requirements that reached from the loggers
themselves in the woods to the sawmill men, to the cut-up plants,
and then followed through the processes of drying and sawing to the
proper utilization of the lumber in the aircraft factories.</p>

<p>In working out these problems, while we drew heavily upon the
experience in Europe, yet we ourselves added our own technical
skill to the solution. The Signal Corps was assisted by the forest
products laboratory at Madison, Wis., and by the wood section of
the inspection department of the Bureau of Aircraft Production.
The United States Forest Service contributed its share of technical
knowledge. At the end of the war we considered that our practice
in the handling of aircraft lumber was superior to that of either
France or England.</p>


<h4>THE SPRUCE PROBLEM.</h4>

<p>Each airplane uses two distinct sorts of wood&mdash;first, the spruce or
similar lumber for the wing beams or other plane parts; and second,
mahogany, walnut, or other hardwoods for propellers. In each case
the Army production authorities were involved both in securing the
lumber and in educating manufacturers to handle it properly.</p>

<p>In an ordinary biplane there are two beams for each lateral wing,
eight beams to the plane. These form the basis of strength for the
wings. Because of the heavy stresses put upon the airplanes by
battle conditions, only the most perfect and straight-grained wood
is suitable for these beams. All cross-grained or spiral-grained
material, or material too coarse in its structure, is useless.</p>

<p>Spruce is the best of all woods for wing beams. Our problem was
to supply lumber enough for the wing beams, disregarding the other
parts, as all other wood used in the manufacture of planes could be
secured from cuttings from the wing-beam stock. At the beginning
we built each beam out of one piece of wood; and this meant that the
lumber must be extra long, thick, and perfect. Until we learned how
to cut the spruce economically we found that only a small portion of
the lumber actually logged was satisfactory for airplanes. An average
sized biplane uses less than 500 feet of lumber. In the hands of
skilled cutters this quantity can be worked out of 1,000 feet of rough
lumber. But in the earlier days of the undertaking as high as 5,000
feet of spruce per plane were actually used because of imperfections
in the lumber, lack of proper inspection at the mills, and faulty
handling in transit and in the factories.</p>

<p>We also used certain species of fir in building training planes. This
wood is, like spruce, light, tough, and strong. The only great source
of supply of these woods was in the Pacific Northwest, although there
was a modest quantity of suitable timber in West Virginia, North
Carolina, and New England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>While at first we expected to rely upon the unaided efforts of the
lumber producers, labor difficulties almost immediately arose in the
Northwest to hinder the production of lumber. The effort, too, was
beset with difficulties of a physical nature, since the large virgin
stands of spruce occurred only at intervals and often at long distances
from the existing railroads. By the middle of October, 1917, it
became evident that the northwestern lumber industry unaided could
not deliver the spruce and fir; and the Chief of Staff of the Army
formed a military organization to handle the situation. On November
6, 1917, Col. Brice P. Disque took command of the Spruce Production
Division of the Signal Corps, this organization later being
transferred to the Bureau of Aircraft Production.</p>

<p>When Col. Disque went into the Northwest he found the industry
in chaotic condition. The I. W. W. was demoralizing the labor forces.
The mills did not have the machinery to cut the straight-grained
lumber needed and their timber experts were not sufficiently skilled
in the selection and judging of logs to secure the maximum footage.
The whole industry was organized along lines of quantity production
and desired to avoid all high quality requirements insisted upon by
the Government.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the military organization was to organize a
society called the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, the
"L. L. L. L.," to offset the I. W. W. propaganda, its platform being, no
strikes, fair wages, and the conscientious production of the Government's
requirements. On March 1, 1918, 75,000 lumbermen and
operators agreed without reservation to give Col. Disque power to
decide all labor disputes. The specifications for logs were then
standardized and modified as far as practicable to meet the manufacturers'
needs. We arranged financial assistance that they might
equip their mills with the proper machinery. We instituted a system
of instruction for the personnel. Finally, the Government fixed a
price for aircraft spruce that stabilized the industry and provided
against delays from labor disputes.</p>

<p>While these basic reforms were being instituted our organization
had energetically taken up the physical problems relating to the work.
We surveyed the existing stands of spruce timber, built railroads connecting
them with the mills, and projected other railroads far into the
future. We began and encouraged logging by farmers in small operations.
By these and other methods employed, the efficiency of this
production effort gradually increased.</p>

<p>In all, we took 180,000,000 feet of aircraft lumber out of the northwestern
forests. To the allies went 120,000,000 feet; to the United
States Army and Navy, 60,000,000 feet.</p>

<p>Yet when we had resolved the difficulties in the forests only
part of the problem had been met. Next came the intricate industrial
question of how to prepare this lumber for aircraft use. We
possessed little knowledge as to the proper methods of seasoning this
timber. The vast majority of woodworking plants in this country,
such as furniture and piano makers, had always dried lumber to the
end that it might keep its shape. We now were faced with the technical
question of drying lumber so as to preserve its strength. The
forest products laboratory worked out a scientific method for this
sort of seasoning. Incidentally they discovered that ordinary commercial
drying had seldom been carried on scientifically. The country
will receive a lasting benefit from this instruction carried broadcast
over the industry.</p>

<p>In the progress of our wood studies we discovered a method of
splicing short lengths of spruce to make wing beams and in the later
months of the production used these spliced beams exclusively at a
great saving in raw materials. The use of laminated beams would
probably have become universal in another year of warfare.</p>


<h4>COTTON FABRIC AND DOPE.</h4>

<p>The flying surfaces of an airplane are made by stretching cloth
over the frames. When we came into war it was supposed that
linen was the only common fabric with sufficient strength for this
use, and linen was almost exclusively used by the airplane builders,
although Italian manufacturers were trying to develop a cotton
fabric. Of the three principal sources of flax, Belgium had been
cut off from the allies, Russia was isolated entirely after the revolution
there, and Ireland was left as the sole available land from which
flax for airplane linen could be obtained.</p>

<p>As late as August, 1917, England assured us that she could supply
all of the linen that would be needed. It rapidly became evident
that England had underestimated our requirements. An average airplane
requires 250 yards of fabric, while some of the large machines
need more than 500 yards. And these requirements do not take
into consideration the spare wings which must be supplied with each
airplane. This meant a demand for millions of yards put upon the
Irish supply, which had no such surplus above allied needs.</p>

<p>For some time prior to April 6, 1917, the Bureau of Standards at
Washington had been experimenting with cotton airplane cloths.
Out of the large variety of fabrics tested several promising experimental
cloths were produced. The chief objection to cotton was that
the dope which gave satisfactory results on linen failed to work with
uniformity on cotton. Therefore, it became apparent that if we
were to use cotton fabric, we should have to invent a new dope.</p>

<p>Two grades of cotton airplane cloth were finally evolved&mdash;A, which
had a minimum strength of 80 pounds per inch, and B, with a minimum
strength of 75 pounds per inch. Grade A was later universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
adopted. This cloth weighed four and one-half ounces per square
yard.</p>

<p>We placed our first orders for cotton airplane fabric in September,
1917&mdash;orders for 20,000 yards&mdash;and from that time on the use of
linen decreased. By March of 1918 the production of cotton airplane
cloth had reached 400,000 yards per month. In May the production
was about 900,000 yards; and when the war ended this material was
being turned out at the rate of 1,200,000 yards per month. Starting
with a few machines, our cotton mills had gradually brought 2,600
looms into the enterprise, each loom turning out about 120 yards
of cloth in a week. A total of 10,248,355 yards of cotton fabric
was woven and delivered to the Government&mdash;over 5,800 miles of
it, nearly enough to reach from California to France. The use of
cotton fabric so expanded that in August, 1918, we discontinued the
importations of linen altogether.</p>

<p>There was, however, danger that we would be limited in our output
of cotton fabric if there were any curtailment in the supply of the
long-staple sea-island and Egyptian cotton of which this cloth is
made. To make sure that there would be no shortage of this material
the Signal Corps in November, 1917, went into the market and
purchased 15,000 bales of sea-island cotton. This at all times gave
us an adequate reserve of raw material for the new fabric.</p>

<p>Cotton proved to be not only an admirable substitute for linen
but even a better fabric than the original cloth which had been used.
No matter how abundant the supply of flax may be, it is unlikely
that linen will ever again be used in large quantities for the manufacture
of airplane wings.</p>

<p>Thus, as the airplane situation was saved by the prompt action
of the Signal Corps in organizing and training the spruce industry,
so again its decision to produce cotton fabric and its prompt action
in cornering the necessary cotton supply made possible the uninterrupted
expansion of the allied aviation program.</p>

<p>The wings of an airplane must not only be covered with fabric,
but the fabric must be filled with dope, which is a sort of varnish.
The function of the dope is to stretch the cloth tight and to create
on it a smooth surface. After the dope is on the fabric the surface
is protected further by a coat of ordinary spar varnish.</p>

<p>We found in the market two sorts of dope which were being furnished
to airplane builders of all countries by various chemical and
varnish manufacturers. One of these dopes was nitrate in character
and was made from nitrocellulose and certain wood-chemical solvents
including alcohol. This produced a surface similar to that of a photographic
film. The other kind of dope had an acetate base and was
made from cellulose-acetate and such wood chemical solvents as
acetone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>The nitrate dope burned rapidly when ignited but the acetate type
was slow burning. Thus in training planes not subject to attack by
enemy incendiary bullets the nitrate dope would be fairly satisfactory,
but in the fighting planes the slow-burning acetate dope was a vital
necessity. Up to our participation in the war the dopes produced in
the United States were principally nitrate in character.</p>

<p>It was evident that we should make our new dope acetate in character
to avoid the danger of fire. But for this we would require great
quantities of acetone and acetate chemicals, and a careful canvass of
the supply of such ingredients showed that it would be impossible for
us to obtain these in anything like the quantities we should require
without developing absolutely new sources of production.</p>

<p>Already acetone and its kindred products were being absorbed in
large quantities by the war production of the allies. The British
Army was absolutely dependent upon cordite as a high explosive.
Acetone is the chemical basis of cordite; and therefore the British
Army looked with great concern upon the added demand which the
American aviation program proposed to put upon the acetone supply.</p>

<p>We estimated that in 1918 we would require 25,000 tons of acetone
in our dope production. The British war mission in this country submitted
figures showing that the war demands of the allies, together
with their necessary domestic requirements, would in themselves be
greater than the total world production of acetone.</p>

<p>There was nothing then for us to do but to increase the source of
supply of these necessary acetate compounds; and this was done by
encouraging, financially and otherwise, the establishment of 10 large
chemical plants. These were located in as many towns and cities, as
follows: Collinwood, Tenn.; Tyrone, Pa.; Mechanicsville, N. Y.;
Shawinigan Falls, Canada; Kingsport, Tenn.; Lyle, Tenn.; Freemont,
Mo.; Sutton, W. Va.; Shelby, Ala.; and Terre Haute, Ind.</p>

<p>But it was evident that before these plants could be completed the
airplane builders would be needing dope; and therefore steps were
taken to keep things going in all the principal countries fighting Germany
until the acetate shortage could be relieved. In December,
1917, we commandeered all the existing American supply of acetate
of lime, the base from which acetone and kindred products are made.
Then we entered into a pool with the allied governments to ration
these supplies of chemicals, pending the era of plenty. Our agency
in this pool was the wood-chemical section of the War Industries
Board, whereas the allies placed their demands in the hands of the
British war mission. These two boards allocated the acetate chemicals
among the different countries according to the urgency of their
demands. Since it was evident there might be financial losses incurred
as the result of the commandeering order or in the project of
the new Government chemical plants, the British war mission agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
that any deficit should be shared equally by the American and
British Governments. It was also agreed we should not have any
advantage in prices paid for acetates of American origin. Under this
arrangement we were able to produce 1,324,356 gallons of fabric dope
during the period of hostilities, without upsetting any of the European
war-production projects. Had the war continued, the output
from the 10 chemical plants in which the Government was a partner
would have cared for all American and allied requirements, allowing
the production of private plants to go exclusively for the ordinary
commercial purposes.</p>


<h4>THE TRAINING PLANES.</h4>

<p>The actual building of the airplanes gave a striking example of the
value of previous experience, either direct or of a kindred nature, in
the quantity production of an article. What airplanes we had built
in the United States&mdash;and the number was small, being less than 800
in the 12 months prior to April, 1917&mdash;had been entirely of the training
type. These had been produced principally for foreign governments.
But this slight manufacture gave us a nucleus of skill and
equipment that we were able to expand to meet our own training
needs almost as rapidly as fields could be equipped and student aviators
enlisted. The training-plane program can be called a success,
as the final production figures show. Of the 11,754 airplanes actually
turned out by American factories, 8,567 were training machines.
This was close to the 10,000 mark set as our ambition in June, 1917.</p>

<p>There are two types of training planes&mdash;those used in the primary
instruction of students and those in the advanced teaching, the
latter approaching the service planes in type. The primary plane
carries the student and the instructor. Each occupant of the
fuselage has before him a full set of controls which are interconnected
so that the instructor at will can do the flying himself, or correct the
student's false moves, or allow the student to take complete charge
of the machine. These primary planes fly at the relatively slow
speed of 75 miles per hour on the average and require engines so
reliable that they need little attention.</p>

<p>For our training planes we adopted the Curtiss JN-4, with the
Curtiss OX-5 engine, and as a supplementary equipment the Standard
Aero Corporation's J-1 plane, with the Hall-Scott A-7-A engine.
Both of these planes and both engines had been previously manufactured
here. The Curtiss equipment, which was the standard at
our training camps, gave complete satisfaction. The J-1 plane was
later withdrawn from use, partly because the plane itself was not
liked, partly because of the vibration resulting from this Hall-Scott
engine, it having only four cylinders, and partly because of the
uncertainty of the engine in cold weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evident that at the start we must turn our entire manufacturing
capacity to the production of training planes, since we
would need these first in any event, and we were not yet equipped
with the knowledge to enable us to make intelligent selections of
service types.</p>

<p>In taking up the manufacturing problem the first step was to divide
the existing responsible airplane plants between the Army and Navy,
following the general rule that a single plant should confine its work
to the needs of one Government department only. There were, of
course, exceptions to this rule. This division gave to the Army the
plants of the&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Curtiss Aeroplane &amp; Motor Corporation, Buffalo, N. Y.</li>
<li>Standard Aircraft Corporation, Elizabeth, N. J.</li>
<li>Thomas-Morse Aircraft Corporation, Ithaca, N. Y.</li>
<li>Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation, Los Angeles, Calif.</li>
<li>Sturtevant Aeroplane Co., Boston, Mass.</li>
</ul>

<p>The factories which fell to the Navy were those of the&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Curtiss Aeroplane &amp; Motor Corporation, Buffalo, N. Y.</li>
<li>The Burgess Co., Marblehead, Mass.</li>
<li>L. W. F. (Lowe, Willard &amp; Fowler) Engineering Co., College Point, Long Island.</li>
<li>Aeromarine Engineering &amp; Sales Co., New York.</li>
<li>Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation, New York.</li>
<li>Boeing Airplane Co., Seattle, Wash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these concerns, Curtiss, Standard, Burgess, L. W. F., Thomas-Morse,
and Wright-Martin were the only ones which had ever built
more than 10 machines.</p>

<p>These factories were quite insufficient in themselves to carry
out the enterprise. Therefore it became necessary to create other
airplane plants. Two new factories thereupon sprang into existence
under Government encouragement. The largest producer of automobile
bodies was the Fisher Body Co., at Detroit, Mich. The manufacture
of automobile bodies is akin to the manufacture of airplanes
to the extent that each is a fabrication of accurate, interchangeable
wood and sheet-steel parts. The Fisher organization brought into
the enterprise not only machinery and buildings but a skilled organization
trained in such production on a large scale.</p>

<p>At Dayton, Ohio, the Dayton-Wright Airplane Corporation was
created. With this company was associated Orville Wright, and
its engineering force was built up around the old Wright organization.
A number of immense buildings which had been recently
erected for other purposes were at once utilized in this new undertaking.</p>

<p>As an addition to these two large sources of supply, J. G. White &amp;
Co. and J. G. Brill &amp; Co., the well-known builders of street cars,
formed the Springfield Aircraft Corporation at Springfield, Mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Also certain forward-looking men on the Pacific coast created in
California several airplane plants, some of which ultimately became
satisfactory producers of training planes.</p>

<p>At this point in the development we were not aware of the great
production of spare parts that would be necessary. Yet we did
understand that there must be a considerable production of spares;
and in order to take the burden of this manufacture from the regular
airplane plants, and also to educate other factories up to the point
where they might undertake the construction of complete airplanes,
we placed many contracts for spare parts with widely scattered
concerns. Among the principal producers of spares were the
following:</p>


<ul><li>The Metz Co., Waltham, Mass.</li>
<li>Sturtevant Aeroplane Co., Jamaica Plains, Mass.</li>
<li>Wilson Body Co., Bay City, Mich.</li>
<li>West Virginia Aircraft Corporation, Wheeling, W. Va.</li>
<li>The Rubay Co., Cleveland, Ohio.</li>
<li>Engel Aircraft Co., Niles, Ohio.</li>
<li>Hayes-Ionia Co., Grand Rapids, Mich.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a long time the supply of spare parts was insufficient for the
needs of the training fields. This was only partly due to the early
lack of a proper realization of the quantity of spares that would be
required. The production of spares on an adequate scale was hampered
by numerous manufacturing difficulties incident to new
industry of any sort in shops unacquainted with the work, and by
a lack of proper drawings for the parts.</p>

<p>As to the training planes themselves, with all factories in the
country devoting themselves to this type exclusively at the start,
the production soon attained great momentum. The Curtiss Co.
particularly produced training planes at a pace far beyond anything
previously obtained. The maximum production of JN-4 machines
was reached in March, 1918, when 756 were turned out.</p>

<p>Advanced training machines are faster, traveling at about 105
miles per hour; and they carry various types of equipment to train observers,
gunners, photographers, and radio men. For this machine we
adopted the Curtiss JN-4H, which was substantially the same as the
primary training plane, except that it carried a 150-horsepower
Hispano-Suiza engine. We also built a few "penguins," a kind
of half airplane that never leaves the ground; but this French method
of training with penguins we never really adopted.</p>

<p>The finishing school for our aviators was in France, where the
training was conducted in Nieuports and other fighting machines.</p>

<p>In July, 1918, we reached the maximum production of the advanced
training machines, the output being 427. As the supply of primary
training planes met the demands of the fields, the production was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
reduced, since the original equipment, kept up by only enough
manufacture to produce spares and replacement machines, would
suffice to train all of the aviators that we would need.</p>

<p>The actual production of training planes by months was as follows:</p>

<h4>THE SERVICE PLANES.</h4>

<p>It was not until we took up the production of fighting, or service,
airplanes that we came into a full realization of the magnitude of
the engineering and manufacturing problems involved.</p>

<p>We had perhaps a dozen men in the United States who knew
something about the designing of flying machines, but not one in
touch with the development of the art in Europe or who was competent
to design a complete fighting airplane. We had the necessary
talent to produce designs and conduct the manufacture of training
planes; but at the outset, at least, we were unwilling to attempt
designs for service planes on our own initiative. At the beginning
we were entirely guided by the Bolling mission in France as to types
of fighting machines.</p>

<p>In approaching this, the more difficult phase of the airplane
problem, our first act was to take an inventory of the engineering
plants in the United States available for our purposes. With the
Curtiss Co. was Glenn Curtiss, a leader of airplane design, and several
competent engineers. The Curtiss Co. had been the largest producers
in the United States of training machines for the British and
had had the benefit of assistance from British engineers, and so
possessed more knowledge and experience to apply to the service-plane
problem than any other company. For this reason we selected
this plant to duplicate the French Spad plane, the story of which
undertaking will be told further on.</p>

<p>Orville Wright, the pioneer of flying, was not in the best of health,
but was devoting his entire time to experimental work in Dayton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Willard, who had designed the L. W. F. airplane and was then with
the Aeromarine Co.; Chas. Day, formerly with the Sloane Manufacturing
Co., and then with the Standard Aero Corporation; Starling
Burgess, with the Burgess Co., of Marblehead, Mass.; Grover C.
Loening, of the Sturtevant Co.; and D. D. Thomas, with the Thomas-Morse
Co., were all aviation engineers on whom we could call. One
of the best experts of this sort in the country was Lieut. Commander
Hunsaker, of the Navy. In the Signal Corps we had Capt. V. E.
Clark, who was also an expert in aviation construction, and he had
several able assistants under him.</p>

<p>The Burgess factory at Marblehead, the Aeromarine plants at
Nutley and Keyport, N. J., and the Boeing Airplane Co. at Seattle
were to work exclusively for the Navy, according to the mutual
agreement, taking their aeronautical engineers with them. This
gave the Army the engineering resources of the Curtiss, Dayton-Wright,
and Thomas-Morse companies.</p>

<p>Quite early we decided to give precedence in this country to the
observation type of service plane, eliminating the single-place fighter
altogether and following the observation planes as soon as possible
with production of two-place fighting machines. This decision was
based on the fact, not always generally remembered, that the
primary purpose of war flying is observation. The duels in the air
that occurred in large numbers, especially during the earlier stages
of the war, were primarily to protect the observation machines or
to prevent observation by enemy machines.</p>

<p>The first service plane which we put into production and which
proved to be the main reliance of our service-plane program was the
De Haviland-4, which is an observation two-place airplane propelled
by a Liberty 12-cylinder engine. As soon as the Bolling mission began
to recommend types of service machines, it sent samples of the planes
thus recommended. The sample De Haviland was received in New
York on July 18, 1917. After it had been studied by various officers
it was sent to Dayton. It had reached us without engine, guns, armament,
or many other accessories later recommended as essential to a
fighting machine. Before we could begin any duplication the plane
had to be redesigned to take our machine guns, our instruments, and
our other accessories, as well as our Liberty engine.</p>

<p>The preliminary designing was complete, and the first American-built
De Haviland model was ready to fly on October 29, 1917.</p>

<p>Figure 11 does not tell quite the complete story of De Haviland
production, since in August and September, 204 De Haviland planes
which had been built were shipped to France without engines and
were there knocked down to provide spare parts for other De Havilands
in service. These 204 machines, therefore, do not appear in
the production total. Adding them to the figures above, we find
that the total output of De Haviland airplanes up to the end of
December, 1918, was in number 4,587.</p>

<p>The production of the model machine only served to show us
some of the problems which must be overcome before we could secure
a standard design that could go into quantity production.
Experimental work on the De Haviland continued during December,
1917, and January and February, 1918. The struggle, for it was a
struggle, to secure harmony between this English design and the
American equipment which it must contain ended triumphantly on
the 8th day of April, 1918, when the machine known as No. 31 was
completely finished and established as the model for the future De
Havilands. The characteristics of the standard American De
Haviland-4 were as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Endurance at 6,500 feet full throttle, 2 hours 13 minutes.</li>
<li>Endurance at 6,500 feet half throttle, 3 hours 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Ceiling, 19,500 feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></li>
<li>Climb to 10,000 feet (loaded) 14 minutes.</li>
<li>Speed at ground level, 124.7 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Speed at 6,500 feet, 120 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Speed at 10,000 feet, 117 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Speed at 15,000 feet, 113 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Weight, bare plane, 2,391 pounds.</li>
<li>Weight, loaded, 3,582 pounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Endurance here means the length of time the fuel supply will
last. The ceiling is the maximum altitude at which the plane can
be maneuvered in actual service. Ground level means only far
enough above the ground to be clear of obstructions.</p>

<p>The first De Havilands arriving in France were immediately
put together, such remediable imperfections as existed were corrected
then and there, and the machines were flown to the training
fields. The changing and increasing demands of the service indicated
the advisability of certain changes of design. The foreign
manufacturers had brought out a covering for the gasoline tanks,
making them nearly leak-proof, even when perforated by a bullet.
In the first De Havilands the location of the principal gas tanks
between the pilot and the observer was not the best arrangement
in that the men were too far apart from each other so that, if the
machine went down, the pilot would be crushed by the gas tank.
Also the radius of action was not considered to be great enough,
even though the later machines of this type carried 88 gallons of
gasoline.</p>

<p>As a result the American aircraft designers brought out an improved
De Haviland known as the 9-A. This carried a Liberty-12 engine; and
the main differences between it and the De Haviland-4 were new
locations for pilot and tanks, their positions being changed about,
increased gasoline capacity, and increased wing surface. The machine
was a cleaner, more finished design, showed slightly more
speed, and had a greater radius of action than the De Haviland-4
which it was planned to succeed. We ordered 4,000 of these new
machines from the Curtiss Co., but the armistice cut short this
production.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of producing new service planes on a
great scale without previous experience in such construction is clearly
shown in the attempts we made to duplicate other successful foreign
planes. On September 12, 1917, we received from the aviation
experts abroad a sample of the French Spad. We had previously
been advised to go into a heavy production of this model and had
made arrangements for the Curtiss Co. at Buffalo to undertake the
work. This development was well under way when in December a
cablegram was received from Gen. Pershing advising us to leave the
production of all single-place fighters to Europe. As a result we
canceled the Spad order, and after that we attempted to build no
single-place pursuit planes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time this course seemed to be justified. The day of the
single seater seemed to be over. The lone occupant of the
single seater can not keep his attention on all directions at once;
and as the planes grew thicker in the air, the casualties among flyers
increased.</p>

<p>But the development of formation flying restored the single-place
machine to favor. The formation had no blind spot, thus removing
the principal objection to the single seater. The end of the war
found the one-man airplane more useful than ever.</p>

<p>Our concentration here, however, was upon two-place fighters.
On August 25, 1917, we received from abroad a sample of the Bristol
fighting plane, a two-seat machine. The Government engineers
at once began redesigning this machine to take the Liberty-12
engine and the American ordnance and accessories. The engine
which had been used in the Bristol plane developed 275 horsepower.
We proposed to equip it with an engine developing 400 horsepower.</p>

<p>The Bristol undertaking was not successful. The fact that later
in the airplane program American designers successfully developed
two-seater pursuit planes around the Liberty-12 engine shows that
the engine decision was not the fault in the Bristol failure. There
were repeated changes in the engineering management of the
Bristol job. First the Government engineers alone undertook it;
then the Government engineers combined with the drafting force of
the airplane factory; finally the Government placed on the factory
the entire responsibility for the job, without, however, permitting
the manufacturer to correct any of the basic principles involved.
All in all, the development of an American Bristol was most unsatisfactory,
and the whole project was definitely abandoned in June, 1918.</p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty in all of these attempts was that we
were trying to fit an American engine to a foreign airplane instead
of building an American airplane around an American engine. It
was inevitable that this difficulty should arise. We had skill to
produce a great engine and did so, but for our earliest models of
planes for this engine we relied upon the foreign models until we
were sufficiently advanced in the art to design for ourselves. We
were successful in making the adaptation only in the case of the De
Haviland and then only after great delay.</p>

<p>But eventually we were to see some brilliantly successful efforts to
design a two-place fighter around the Liberty-12. We had need of
such a mechanism to supplement the De Haviland observation-plane
production and make a complete service-plane program.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1918, Capt. Lepere, a French aeronautical engineer,
who had formerly been with the French Government at St. Cyr,
began experimental work on a new plane at the factory of the Packard
Motor Car Co. By May 18 his work had advanced to a stage where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the Government felt justified in entering into a contract with the
Packard Co. to provide shop facilities for the production of 25 experimental
planes under Capt. Lepere's direction. The result of these
efforts was a two-place fighting machine built around a Liberty
engine. From the start this design met with the approval of the
manufacturer and engineers because of its clean-cut perfection.</p>

<p>Here at last was a machine that performed brilliantly in the air
and contained great possibilities for quantity production, because it
was designed from the start to fit American manufacturing methods.
We placed orders for 3,525 Lepere machines. None of the factories,
however, had come into production with the Lepere on
November 11, 1918. Seven sample machines had been turned out
and put through every test. It was the belief of those in authority
that at last the training and technique of the best aeronautical
engineers of France had been combined with the Liberty, probably
the best of all aerial engines; and it was believed that the spring of
1919 would see the Yankee fliers equipped with American fighting
machines that would be superior to anything they would be required
to meet.</p>

<p>Nor were these expectations without justification. The weeks and
months following the declaration of the armistice and extending
through to the spring of 1919 were to witness the birth of a whole
brood of new typically American designs of airplanes of which the
Lepere was the forerunner. In short, when the armistice brought
the great aviation enterprise to an abrupt end, the American industry
had fairly caught that of Europe, and America designers were ready
to match their skill against that of the master builders of France,
Great Britain, Italy, and the central powers.</p>

<p>The Lepere 2-seated fighter was quickly followed by two other
Lepere models&mdash;one of them, known as the Lepere C-21, being
armored, and driven by a Bugatti engine, and the other a triplane driven
by two Liberty engines and designed to be a day bomber. Then the
first American designed single-seat pursuit planes began making their
appearance&mdash;the Thomas-Morse pursuit plane, its 164 miles an hour
at ground level, making it the fastest airplane ever tested by our Government,
if it were not the speediest plane ever built; the Ordnance
Engineering Corporation's Scout, an advanced training plane; and
several others. In two-seater fighting planes there was the Loening
monoplane, an extremely swift and advanced type. There were
several other new two-seaters designed experimentally in some instances
and some of them giving brilliant promise.</p>

<p>Perhaps the severest and most exacting critic of aviation material
is the aviator who has to fly the plane and fight with the equipment
at the front. Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, then a colonel, was sent to
France in 1917. He became in succession chief of the air service of
the First Army Corps, chief of the air service of the First Army, and
finally chief of the air service of the American group of armies in
France. He commanded the aerial operations at the reduction of the
St. Mihiel salient, where he gained the distinction of having commanded
more airplanes in action than were ever assembled before
under a single command. At St. Mihiel there were 1,200 allied planes
in action, including, with our own, French, English, and Italian planes.</p>

<p>Gen. Mitchell, therefore, is a high authority as to the relative merits
of air equipment from the airman's standpoint. In the spring of 1919,
after a thorough investigation of the latest types of American planes
and aerial equipment at the Wilbur Wright Field at Dayton, he sent
to the Director of Air Service, Washington, D. C., the following telegram
under date of April 20, 1919:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I recommend the following airplanes in the numbers given be purchased at once:
100 Lepere 2-place corps observation, 50 Loening 2-place pursuit, 100 Ordnance Engineering
Corporation 1-place pursuit, 100 Thomas-Morse 1-place pursuit, 50 USD9-A
day bombardment, 700 additional Hispano-Suiza 300-horsepower engines, 2,000 parachutes.
All of the above types are the equal of or better than anything in Europe.</p></div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mitchell.</span></p>

<p>Now, let us see some of the specifications and performances of these
new models. The USD9-A, being the redesigned and improved
De Haviland 4, may be given a place as a latest model. It is a two-place
bombing plane of the tractor biplane type, equipped with a
Liberty 12 engine and weighing 4,872 pounds, loaded with fuel, oil,
guns, and bombs, and with its crew aboard. With this weight its
performance record in the official tests at Wilbur Wright Field in
Dayton was as follows:</p>

<p>The Thomas-Morse pursuit plane is armed with two Browning
machine guns synchronized with the propeller and carries 1,500
rounds of ammunition.</p>

<p>Uncertain as we were originally as to types of pursuit and observation
planes to produce in this country, we were still more uncertain
as to designs of night-bombing machines. These relatively
slow weight-carrying planes were big and required the motive
power of two or three engines, with the complications attendant
upon double or triple power plants. They really presented the most
difficult manufacturing problem which we encountered. Until the
summer of 1918 there were only two machines of this type which we
could adopt, the Handley-Page and the Caproni. We put the
Handley-Page into production, not because it was necessarily as
perfect as the Caproni, but because we could get the drawings for
this machine and could not get the drawings for the Caproni, owing
to complications in the negotiations for the right to construct the
Italian airplane.</p>

<p>We were not entirely satisfied with the decision to build Handley-Pages,
because the ceiling, or maximum working altitude which
could be attained by this machine, was low; and, 12 months later,
when we were in production, we might find the Handley-Pages of
doubtful value because of the ever-increasing ranges of antiaircraft
guns.</p>

<p>We secured a set of drawings, supposed to be complete, for the
Handley-Page in August, 1917; but twice during the following
winter new sets of drawings were sent from England, and few, if any,
of the parts as designed in the original drawings escaped alteration.
The Handley-Page has a wing spread of over 100 feet. Therefore,
it was evident from the start that such machines could not have the
fuselage, wings, and other large parts assembled in this country for
shipment complete to Europe. We decided to manufacture the parts
in this country and assemble the machines in England, the British
air ministry in London having entered into a contract for the creation
of an assembling factory at Oldham, England, in the Lancashire
district. When it is realized that each Handley-Page involves
100,000 separate parts, the magnitude of the manufacturing job
alone may be somewhat understood. But after they were manufactured,
these parts, particularly the delicate members made of
wood, had to be carefully packed so as to reach England in good
condition. The packing of the parts was in itself a problem.</p>

<p>We proposed to drive the American Handley-Pages with two
Liberty 12 engines in each machine. The fittings, which were extremely
intricate pieces of pressed steel work, were practically all to
be produced by the Mullins Steel Boat Co. at Salem, Ohio. Contracts
for the other parts were placed with the Grand Rapids Air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>plane
Co., a concern which had been organized by a group of furniture
makers at Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>

<p>All of the parts were to be brought together previously to ocean
shipment in a warehouse built for the purpose at the plant of the
Standard Aero Corporation at Elizabeth, N. J. The Standard Aero
Corporation was engaged under contract to set up 10 per cent of the
Handley-Page machines complete in this country. These were to
be used at our training fields.</p>

<p>Again, in the case of the Handley-Page, the engineering details
proved to be a serious cause of delay. We found it difficult to install
the Liberty engines in this foreign plane. When the armistice cut
short operations, 100 complete sets of parts had been shipped to
England, and seven complete machines had been assembled in this
country.</p>

<p>None of the American-built Handley-Page machines saw service in
France. There had been great delay in the construction of the assembling
plant in England, and the work of setting up the machines had
only started when the armistice was signed. The performance table
of the Handley-Page shows its characteristics as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Speed at ground level, 97 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Climb to 7,000 feet, 18 minutes 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Climb to 10,000 feet, 29 minutes.</li>
<li>Ceiling 14,000 feet, 60 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>On its tests 390 gallons of gasoline, 20 gallons of oil, and 7 men were
carried, but no guns, ammunition, nor bombs.</p>

<p>After a long delay, about January 1, 1918, tentative arrangements
had been made with the Caproni interests looking toward the production
of Caproni biplanes in this country. These machines had a
higher ceiling and a greater speed than the Handley-Page. Capt.
d'Annunzio with 14 expert Italian workmen, bringing with him
designs and samples, came to this country and initiated the redesigning
of the Caproni machine to accommodate three Liberty engines.
The actual production of Caproni planes in this country was limited
to a few samples which were being tested when the armistice was
signed. The factories had tooled up for the production, however,
and in a few months Capronis would doubtless have been produced
in liberal quantities.</p>

<p>The performance of the sample planes in two tests is shown by the

<p>As we had produced fighting planes built around the Liberty
motor, so, too, in the night-bombing class American invention, with
the experience of several months of actual production behind it, was
able to bring out an American bombing plane that promised to supersede
all other types in existence. This machine was designed by
Glen L. Martin in the fall of 1918. It was a night-bomber equipped
with two Liberty 12-cylinder engines. The Martin spread of 75 feet
gave it a carrying capacity comparable with that of the Handley-Page.
Its speed of 118 miles an hour at ground level far exceeded
that of either the Caproni or Handley-Page, and it was evident that
its ceiling would be higher than that of the Caproni, the estimated
ceiling of the Martin being 18,000 feet. The machine never reached
the state of actual quantity production, but several experimental
models were built and tested. Being built around its engine it reflected
clean-cut principles of design, and its performances in the air
were truly remarkable for a machine of its type. The following table
shows the results of the preliminary tests of the Martin bomber:</p>

<p>The actual strength of the central powers in the air is at this time
not definitely known to us. Such figures as we have are viewed with
suspicion because of the two methods of observation in reporting an
enemy squadron. This may be 24 planes to a squadron, that number
representing the planes in active service in the air. But each squadron
had a complement of replacement planes equalling the number
of active planes, so that the squadron could be listed with 48 planes.</p>

<p>However, as some indication of the relative air strengths of the
central powers we have a report from the chief of the Air Service of
the American Expeditionary Forces showing that on July 30, 1918,
Germany had 2,592 planes on the front and Austria 717.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE LIBERTY ENGINE.</h3>


<p>The Liberty engine was America's distinctive contribution to the war
in the air, and her chief one. The engine was developed in those first
chaotic weeks of preparation of 1917, when our knowledge of planes,
instruments, and armament as then known in Europe was still a
thing of the future. The manufacture of engines for any aeronautical
purpose was one which we might approach with confidence.
We possessed in the United States motor engineering talent at least
as great as any in Europe, while in facilities for manufacture&mdash;in
plants which had built our millions of automobile engines&mdash;no other
part of the world could compare with us. Therefore, while waiting
word from Europe as to the best type of wings, fuselages, instruments
and the like, we went ahead to produce for ourselves a new, typically
American engine which would uphold the prestige of America in
actual battle.</p>

<p>Many Americans have doubtless wondered why we built our own
engine instead of adopting one or more of the highly developed
European engines then at hand; and no doubt our course in this vital
matter has sometimes been set down to mere pride in our ability
and to an unwillingness to follow the lead of other nations in a science
in which we ourselves were preeminent&mdash;the science of building light
internal-combustion engines. But national pride, aside from giving
us confidence that our efforts in this direction would be successful,
had little other weight in the decision. There were other reasons,
and paramount ones, reasons leading directly from the necessity for
the United States to arrive at her maximum aerial effort in a minimum
of time, that irresistibly compelled the aircraft production
organization to design a standard American engine. Let us examine
some of these considerations.</p>

<p>If there was anything to be observed from this side of the Atlantic
with respect to the tendencies of aircraft evolution in Europe it was
that the horsepowers of the engines were continually increasing, these
expansions coming almost from month to month as newer and newer
types and sizes of engines were brought out by the European inventors.
It was evident to us that there was not a single foreign engine
then in use on the western front that was likely to survive the test of
time. Each might be expected to have its brief day of supremacy,
only to be superseded by something more modern and more powerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet time was an element to which in this country we must give
grave consideration. To produce in quantities such as we were
capable of producing would ordinarily require a year of maximum
industrial effort to equip our manufacturing plants with the machines,
tools, and skilled workmen necessary for the production of parts.
The finished articles would under normal circumstances begin coming
in quantity during the second year of our program. It would have
been fatal to "tool up" our plants for the manufacture of equipment
that would be out of date by the time we began producing it a year
later.</p>

<p>The obvious course for the United States to adopt, not only with
engines but with all sorts of aeronautical equipment, was to come into
the manufacturing competition not abreast with European progress
but several strides ahead of it, so that when we appeared on the field
it would be with equipment a little in advance in type and efficiency
of anything the rest of the world had to offer.</p>

<p>This factor of time was a strong element in the decision to produce
a standard American engine, since with the possible exception of the
Rolls-Royce there was no engine in Europe of sufficient horsepower
and proved reliability to guarantee that it would retain its serviceability
for the necessary two years upon which we must reckon.
There was no other course that we could safely adopt.</p>

<p>But there were other conditions that influenced our conclusion.
We believed that we could design and produce an engine much more
quickly and with much better results than we could copy and produce
any approved foreign model. This proved to be true in actual experience.
Along with the production of Liberty engines we went into
the quantity manufacture of a number of European engines in this
country; and the experience of our engineers and factory executives
in this work was anything but pleasant. Among others we produced
in American factories the Gnome, the Hispano-Suiza, Le Rhone, and
the Bugatti engines.</p>

<p>Now European manufacture of mechanical appliances differs from
ours largely in the degree to which the human equation is allowed to
enter the shop. In continental practice much of the metallurgical
specifications and also of the details of mechanical measurements,
limits of requisite accuracy, variations which can be allowed,
etc., are not put on paper in detail for the guidance of operators, but
are confided to the recollections of the individual workmen. A machine
comes in its parts to the assembly room of a foreign factory, and
after that it is subject to adjustments on the part of the skilled workmen
before its operation is successful. It must be tinkered with
before it will go, so to speak. Nothing of the sort is known in an
American factory. When standard parts come together for assembly
the calibrations must have been so exact that the machine will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
function perfectly when it is brought together; and assembling becomes
mere routine. Thus when we came to adopt foreign plans and
attempt to adapt them to our practices, we encountered trouble and
delay.</p>

<p>Thirteen months were required to adapt the Hispano-Suiza 150-horsepower
engine to our factory methods and to get the first engine
from production tools, while eight months were similarly spent in producing
the Le Rhone 80-horsepower engines. Both of these engines
had been in production in European factories for a long time, and we
had the advantage of all the assistance which the foreign manufacturers
could give us.</p>

<p>These experiences merely confirmed the opinions of American
manufacturers that the preparations for the production of any
aviation engine of foreign design&mdash;if any such suitable and adequate
engine could be found&mdash;would require at least as much time as to
design and tool up for the production of an American engine. When
to this was added the necessity of waiting for several weeks or
months for a decision on the part of our aviation authorities, either in
the United States or in Europe, as to which of the many types of engines
then in use by the allies should be put into production here, procuring
and shipping to this country suitable samples, drawings, and specifications,
negotiating with foreign owners for rights to manufacture,
etc., there was but one answer to be made on this score, and that was
to design and build an all-American engine.</p>

<p>Another factor in the decision was that of our distance from
France, a fact making it necessary for us to simplify as much as possible
the problem of furnishing repair parts. At the time we entered
the war the British air service was using or developing 37
different makes of engines, while France had 46. Should we be lured
into any such situation it might have disastrous results, if only because
of the difficulties of ocean transportation. Germany was practically
concentrating upon not more than 8 engines. The obvious thing for
us to do was to produce as few types of engines as possible, thus
making simpler the problem of manufacturing repair parts and
shipping them to the front.</p>

<p>With these considerations in mind, the Equipment Division of the
Signal Corps in May of 1917 determined to go ahead with the design
and production of a standard engine for the fighting forces of the
aviation branch of the Army. In the engineering field two men stood
out who combined in themselves experience in designing internal-combustion
engines which approached nearest to combat engines,
with experience also in large quantity production.</p>

<p>J. G. Vincent, with the engineering staff of the Packard Motor Car
Co., had for approximately two years been engaged in research work,
developing several types of 12-cylinder aviation engines of approxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>mately
125 to 225 horsepower, which, however, were not suitable
for military purposes because of their weight per horsepower. This
work had resulted in the acquirement of a large amount of data and
information which would be invaluable in the design of such an
engine as the one proposed; and also had resulted in the upbuilding
of an efficient experimental organization. He had also had wide
experience in designing internal-combustion motors for quantity
production.</p>

<p>E. J. Hall, of the Hall-Scott Motor Car Co., for eight years had been
developing and latterly producing several types of aeronautical
engines, which he had delivered into the service of several foreign
governments, including Russia, Norway, China, Japan, Australia,
Canada, and England. He had also completed and tested a 12-cylinder
engine of 300 horsepower, which, however, was of too great
weight per horsepower to be suitable in its form at that time for
military purposes. He had thus acquired a large experience and
fund of information covering the proper areas and materials for engine
parts, and proper methods of tests to be applied to such engines, and
in addition he had general experience in quantity production. All of
this information and experience was of invaluable assistance not only
in designing the new engine, but in determining its essential metallurgical
and manufacturing specifications.</p>

<p>These two men were thus qualified in talent and in practice to lay
down on paper the lines and dimensions of the proposed engine, an
engine that would meet the Army's requirements and still be readily
capable of prompt quantity production. They had in their hands
the power to draw freely upon the past experience and achievement
of practically the entire world for any features they might decide to
install in the model power plant to be produced. And this applied
not only to the patented features of American motors, but also of
foreign engines; for each man had exhaustively studied the leading
European engines, including the Mercedes upon which Germany
largely pinned her faith up to the end of the war.</p>

<p>With respect to American motor patents, an interesting situation
had arisen in the automobile industry. The leading producers of
motor cars were in an association which had adopted an arrangement
known as the cross-licensing agreement. Under this agreement all
patents taken out by the various producers (with a few exceptions)
were thrown into a pool upon which any producer at will was permitted
to draw without payment of royalties.</p>

<p>A similar arrangement was adopted with respect to the Liberty
engine, except that the Government pledged itself to pay an agreed
royalty for the use of patents. Thus the engineers designing the
engine might reach out and take what they pleased regardless of
patent rights. The result was likely to be a composite type embracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the best features of the best engines ever built. Theoretically, at
least, a super-engine ought to result from such an effort.</p>

<p>The ideal aviation engine should produce a maximum of power with
a minimum of weight; it must run at its maximum power during a
large proportion of its operating time, a thing that an automobile
motor seldom, if ever, does for more than a few minutes at a time;
and it should consume oil and fuel economically to conserve space
and weight on the airplane.</p>

<p>Such was the problem, the design of an engine to meet these requirements,
that confronted these two engineers when they were called to
Washington and asked to undertake the work.</p>

<p>There have been so many versions of the story of how the Liberty
engine was designed and produced in its experimental models that
it is fitting that the exact history of those memorable weeks should
be set down here.</p>

<p>The engine was put on paper in the rooms occupied by Col. E. A.
Deeds at the Willard Hotel in Washington. Col. Deeds had been
the man of broad vision who, by taking into consideration the elements
of the problems enumerated above, determined that America
could best make her contribution to the aviation program by producing
her typically own engine. He had proposed the plan to his associate,
Col. S. D. Waldon, who had thereupon studied the matter and
agreed entirely with the plan. The two officers persuaded Messrs.
Hall and Vincent to forego further efforts on their individual developments
and to devote their combined skill and experience to the
creation of an all-American engine. The project was further taken
up with the European authorities in Washington, and it was supported
unanimously.</p>

<p>In these conferences it was decided to design two lines of combat
engines. Each should have a cylinder diameter of 5 inches and a
piston stroke 7 inches long; but one type should have 8 cylinders and
the other 12. The 8-cylinder engine should develop 225 horsepower,
as all the experts believed then, in May, 1917, that such a motor
would anticipate the power requirements as of the spring of 1918,
while the 12-cylinder engine should develop 330 horsepower, as it
was believed that this would be the equal of any other engine developed
through 1919 and 1920. Every foreign representative in
Washington with aeronautical experience agreed that the 8-cylinder
225-horsepower engine would be the peer of anything in use in the
spring of 1918; yet, so rapidly was aviation history moving that inside
of 90 days it became equally clear that it was the 12-cylinder
engine of 330 horsepower, and not the 8-cylinder engine, upon which
we should concentrate for the spring of 1918.</p>

<p>With these considerations in mind Messrs. Hall and Vincent set to
work to lay out the designs on paper. With them were Col. Deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
and Col. Waldon, the officers to insist that nothing untried or experimental
be incorporated in the engines, the engineers to direct their
technical knowledge by this sine qua non. The size of the cylinders,
5 by 7 inches, was adopted not only because the Curtiss and the
Hall-Scott Companies, the largest producers of aviation engines in the
United States, had had experience with engines of this size, but also
because a new and promising French engine, the Lorraine-Dietrich,
had just made its appearance in experimental form, and it was an
engine approximately of that size.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1917, Messrs. Vincent and Hall set to work. Within
two or three days they had outlined the important characteristics of
the engine sufficiently to secure&mdash;on June 4&mdash;the approval of the
Aircraft Production Board and of the Joint Army and Navy Technical
Board to build five experimental models each of the 8 cylinder and
the 12 cylinder sizes.</p>

<p>The detail and manufacturing drawings of the two engines were
made partly by the staff of the Packard Motor Car Co., under Mr.
O. E. Hunt, and partly by an organization recruited from various
automobile factories and put to work under Mr. Vincent at the Bureau
of Standards at Washington. Due credit must here be given to Dr.
S. W. Stratton, the director of that important governmental scientific
bureau. The Liberty engine pioneers woke him up at midnight and
told him of their needs. He promptly tendered all the facilities of
the Bureau of Standards, turning over to the work an entire building
for use the following morning. Thereafter Dr. Stratton gave
the closest cooperation of himself and his assistants to the work.</p>

<p>While the detail drawings were being made, the parts for the 10
engines were at once started through the tool rooms and experimental
shops of various motor car companies. This work centered in the
plant of the Packard Co., which gave to it its entire energy and wonderful
faculties.</p>

<p>Every feature in the design of these engines was based on thoroughly
proven practice of the past. That the engine was a composite is
shown by the origin of its various parts:</p>

<p>Cylinders: The Liberty engine derived its type of cylinders from the
German Mercedes, the English Rolls-Royce, the French Lorraine-Dietrich,
and others produced both before and during the war. The
cylinders were steel inner shells surrounded by pressed-steel water
jackets. The Packard Co. had developed a practical production
method of welding together the several parts of a steel cylinder.</p>

<p>Cam shafts and valve mechanism above cylinder heads: The
design of these was based on the general arrangement of the Mercedes
and Rolls-Royce, and improved by the Packard Motor Car Co. for
automatic lubrication without wasting oil.</p>

<p>Cam-shaft drive: The general type as used on the Hall-Scott,
Mercedes, Hispano-Suiza, Rolls-Royce, Renault, Fiat, and others.</p>

<p>Angle between cylinders: In the Liberty the included angle between
the cylinders is 45&deg;. This angle was adopted to save head resistance,
to give greater strength to the crank case, and to reduce periodic
vibration. This decision was based on the experience of the Renault
and Packard engines.</p>

<p>Electric generator and ignition: The Delco system was adopted,
but specially designed for the Liberty to provide a reliable double
ignition.</p>

<p>Pistons: The die-cast aluminum-alloy pistons of the Liberty were
based on development work by the Hall-Scott Co. under service
conditions.</p>

<p>Connecting rods: These were of the forked or straddle type as used
on the DeDion and Cadillac automobile motors and also on the
Hispano-Suiza and other aviation engines.</p>

<p>Crank shaft: A design of standard practice, every crank pin operating
between two main bearings, as in the Mercedes, Rolls-Royce,
Hall-Scott, Curtiss, and Renault.</p>

<p>Crank case: A box section carrying the shaft in bearings clamped
between the top and bottom halves by means of long through bolts,
as in the Mercedes and Hispano-Suiza.</p>

<p>Lubrication: The system of lubrication was changed, this being the
only change of design made in the Liberty after it was first put down
on paper. The original system combined the features of a dry crank
case, such as in the Rolls-Royce, with pressure feed to the main
crank-shaft bearings and scupper feed to the crank-pin bearings, as
in the Hall-Scott and certain foreign engines. The system subsequently
adopted added pressure-feed to the crank-pin bearings, as
in the Rolls-Royce, Hispano-Suiza, and other engines.</p>

<p>Propeller hub: Designed after the practice followed by such well-known
engines as the Hispano-Suiza and Mercedes.</p>

<p>Water pump: The conventional centrifugal type was adapted to
the Liberty.</p>

<p>Carburetor: The Zenith type was adapted to the engine.</p>

<p>As the detailed and manufacturing drawings were completed in
Washington and Detroit they were taken to various factories where
the parts for the first engine were built.</p>

<p>The General Aluminum &amp; Brass Manufacturing Co., of Detroit,
made the bronze-back, babbitt-lined bearings.</p>

<p>The Cadillac Motor Car Co., of Detroit, made the connecting rods,
the connecting-rod upper-end bushings, the connecting-rod bolts, and
the rocker-arm assemblies.</p>

<p>The L. O. Gordon Manufacturing Co., of Muskegon, Mich., made
the cam shafts.</p>

<p>The Park Drop Forge Co., of Cleveland, made the crank-shaft
forgings. These forgings, completely heat treated, were turned out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in three days, because Mr. Hall gave the Cleveland concern permission
to use the Hall-Scott dies.</p>

<p>The Packard Motor Car Co. machined the crank shafts and all
parts not furnished or finished elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Hall-Scott Motor Car Co., of Berkeley, Calif., made all the
bevel gears.</p>

<p>The Hess-Bright Manufacturing Co., of Philadelphia, made the
ball bearings.</p>

<p>The Burd High-Compression Ring Co., of Rockford, Ill., made the
piston rings.</p>

<p>The Aluminum Castings Co., of Cleveland, made the die-cast alloy
pistons and machined them up to grinding.</p>

<p>The Rich Tool Co., of Chicago, made the valves.</p>

<p>The Gibson Co., of Muskegon, Mich., made the springs.</p>

<p>The Packard Co. made all the patterns for the aluminum castings,
which were produced by the General Aluminum &amp; Brass Manufacturing
Co., of Detroit.</p>

<p>The Packard Motor Car Co. used many of its own dies in order to
obtain suitable drop forgings speedily, and also made all necessary
new dies not made elsewhere.</p>

<p>As these various parts were turned out they were hurried to the
tool room of the Packard Co., where the assembling of the model
engines was in progress.</p>

<p>Before the models were built, however, extraordinary precautions
had been taken to insure that the mechanism would be as perfect as
American engineering skill could make it. The plans as developed
were submitted to H. M. Crane, the engineer of the Simplex Motor
Car Co. and of the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation, who had
made a special study of aviation engines in Europe, and who for
upward of a year had been working on the production of the Hispano-Suiza
150-horsepower engine in this country. He looked the plans
over, and so did David Fergusson, chief engineer of the Pierce-Arrow
Motor Car Co. Many other of the best experts in the country in the
production of internal-combustion motors constructively criticized
the plans, these including such men as Henry M. Leland and George
H. Layng, of the Cadillac Motor Car Co., and F. F. Beall and Edward
Roberts, of the Packard Car Co.</p>

<p>When the engineers were through, the practical production men were
given their turn. The plane and engine builders examined the
plans to make sure that each minute part was so designed as to make
it most adaptable to quantity production. The scrutiny of the
Liberty plans went back in the production scale even farther than
this; for the actual builders of machine tools were called in to examine
the specifications and to suggest modifications, if necessary, that
would make the production of parts most feasible in machine tools
either of existing types or of easiest manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus scrutinized and criticized, the plans of the engine were the
best from every point of view which American industrial genius could
produce in the time which was available. It was due to this exhaustive
preliminary study that no radical changes were ever made
in the original design. The Liberty engine was not the materialization
of magic nor the product of any single individual or company,
but it was a well-considered and carefully prepared design based on
large practical aviation-engine experience.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1917, the first 8-cylinder liberty engine was delivered
in Washington. This was less than six weeks after Messrs. Hall and
Vincent drew the first line of their plans. The same procedure was
even then being repeated in the case of the 12-cylinder engine. By
the 25th day of August the model 12-cylinder liberty had successfully
passed its 50-hour test. In this test its power ranged from 301
to 320 horsepower.</p>

<p>As an achievement in speed in the development of a successful
new engine this performance has never been equaled in the motor
history of any country. No successful American automobile motor
was ever put in production in anything under a year of trial and
experimentation. We may well believe that in the third year of war
the European aviation designers were working at top speed to improve
the motive power of airplanes; yet in 1917 the British war cabinet
report contains the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Experience shows that as a rule, from the date of the conception and design of an
aero engine, to the delivery of the first engine in series by the manufacturer, more
than a year elapses.</p></div>

<p>But America designed and produced experimentally a good engine
in six weeks and a great one in three months, and began delivering it
in series in five months. This was due to the fact that we could
employ our best engineering talent without stint, to the further fact
that there were no restrictions upon our use of designs and patents
proved successful by actual experience, and to the fact that the
original engine design produced under such conditions stood every
expert criticism and test that could be put upon it and emerged
from the trial without substantial modification.</p>

<p>As soon as the first Liberty models had passed their official tests
plans were at once made to put them in manufacture.</p>

<p>The members of the Aircraft Production Board chose for the chief
of the engine production department Harold H. Emmons, an attorney
and manufacturer of Detroit, Mich., who, as a lieutenant in the
Naval Reserve Force, was just being called by the Navy Department
into active service.</p>

<p>The production of all aviation engines, for both Army and Navy,
was in his hands throughout the rest of the war. He placed
orders for 100,993 aviation engines of all types, which involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the expenditure of $450,000,000 and more of Government funds.
Of these 31,814 were delivered ready for service before the signing
of the armistice. The United States reached a daily engine production
greater than that of England and France combined.</p>

<p>In August, 1917, it was intended to manufacture both engines, the
8-cylinder and the 12-cylinder, and an agreement was reached with
the Ford Motor Co. of Detroit to produce 8-cylinder Liberty engines
to the number of 10,000. But before this contract could be signed
the increasing powers of the newest European air engines indicated
to our commission abroad that we should concentrate our manufacturing
efforts upon the 12 alone, that being the engine of a power
then distinctly in advance in the rapid evolution of aviation engines.
The engine production department, therefore, entered into contracts
for the construction of 22,500 of the 12-cylinder Liberties, and the
first of these contracts was signed in August, a few days after the
endurance tests had demonstrated that the 12-cylinder engine was
a success.</p>

<p>Of this number of Liberty engines the Packard Motor Car Co.
contracted to build 6,000; the Lincoln Motor Co., 6,000; the
Ford Motor Co., 5,000; Nordyke &amp; Marmon, 3,000; the General
Motors Corporation (Buick and Cadillac plants), 2,000; while
an additional contract of 500 engines was let to the Trego Motors
Corporation.</p>

<p>Early in the liberty engine project it became apparent that one
of the great stumbling blocks to volume production would be the
steel cylinder, if it were necessary to machine it out of a solid or
partially pierced forging such as is used for shell making. This
problem was laid before Henry Ford and the engineering organization
of the Ford Motor Co., at Detroit, and they developed the unique
method of making the cylinders out of steel tubing. One end of
the tube was cut obliquely, heated, and in successive operations
closed over and then expanded into the shape of the combustion
chamber, with all bosses in place on the dome. The lower
end was then heated and upset in a bulldozer until the holding-down
flange had been extruded from the barrel at the right place.
By this method a production of 2,000 rough cylinders a day was
reached.</p>

<p>The final forging was so near to the shape desired that millions
of pounds of scrap were saved over other methods, to say nothing
of an enormous amount of labor thus done away with. The development
of this cylinder-making method was one of the important
contributions to the quantity production of Liberty engines.</p>

<p>It was evident that in the actual production of the Liberty engine
there would continually arise practical questions of manufacturing
policy that might entail modifications of the manufacturing methods,
while our aviation authorities in Europe could be expected to advance
suggestions from time to time that might need to be embodied in
the mechanism. Consequently it was necessary to create a permanent
development and standardization administration for the Liberty
engine. Nor could this supervision be located in Washington,
because of the extreme need for haste, but it must exist in the vicinity
of the plants doing the manufacturing.</p>

<p>For this reason the production of the Liberty engine was centered
in the Detroit manufacturing district, since in this district was
located the principal motor manufacturing plant capacity of the
United States. James G. Heaslet, formerly general manager of the
Studebaker Corporation and an engineer and manufacturer of wide
experience, was installed as district manager. The problems incident
to the inspection and production of the Liberty engine were placed in
charge of a committee consisting of Maj. Heaslet (chairman); Lieut.
Col. Hall, one of the designers of the engine; Henry M. Leland;
C. Harold Wills, of the Ford Motor Co.; and Messrs F. F. Beall and
Edward Roberts, of the Packard Motor Car Co. With them were
also associated D. McCall White, the engineer of the Cadillac Motor
Co., and Walter Chrysler, of the Buick Co.</p>

<p>The creation of this committee virtually made a single manufacturing
concern of the several, previously rival, motor companies engaged
in producing the Liberty engine. To these meetings the experts
without reservation brought the trade secrets and shop processes
developed in their own establishments during the preceding
years of competition. Such cooperation was without parallel in the
history of American industry, and only a great emergency such as the
war with Germany could have brought it about. But the circumstance
aided wonderfully in the development and production of the
Liberty engine.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Government drew heavily upon the talent of these
great manufacturing organizations for meeting the special problems
presented by the necessity of filling in the briefest possible time the
largest aviation engine order ever known. Short-cuts that these firms
might have applied effectively to their own private advantage were devised
for the Liberty engine and freely turned over to the Government.
The Packard Co. gave a great share of its equipment and personnel
to the development. The most conspicuous success in the science
of quantity production in the world was the Ford Motor Co., which
devoted its organization to the task of speeding up the output of
Liberty engines. In addition to the unique and wonderfully efficient
method of making rough engine cylinders out of steel tubing,
the Ford organization also perfected for the Liberty a new method
of producing more durable and satisfactory bearings. Messrs. H. M.
and W. C. Leland, whose names were indissolubly linked with the
Cadillac automobile, organized and erected the enormous plant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the Lincoln Motor Co. and equipped it for the production of the
Liberty, at a total expense of approximately $8,000,000.</p>

<p>Balanced against these advantages brought by highly trained technical
skill and unselfish cooperation were handicaps such as perhaps no
other great American industrial venture had ever known. In the first
place, an internal-combustion engine with cylinders of a 5-inch bore
and pistons of a 7-inch stroke&mdash;the Liberty measurements&mdash;was
larger than the automobile engines then in use in this country. This
meant that while we apparently had an enormous plant&mdash;the combined
American automobile factories&mdash;ready for the production of
Liberty engines, actually the machinery in these plants was not large
enough for the new work, so that new machinery therefore must be
built to handle this particular work. In some cases machinery had
to be designed anew for the special purpose.</p>

<p>To produce every part of one Liberty engine something between
2,500 and 3,000 small jigs, tools, and fixtures are employed. For large
outputs much of this equipment must be duplicated over and over
again. To provide the whole joint workshop with this equipment was
one of the unseen jobs incidental to the construction of Liberty
engines&mdash;unseen by the general public, that is&mdash;yet it required the
United States to commandeer the capacity of all available tool shops
east of the Mississippi River and devote it to the production of jigs
and tools for the Liberty engine factories.</p>

<p>Then there was the question of mechanical skill in the factories.
It soon developed that an automobile motor is a simple mechanism
compared with an intricate aviation engine. The machinists in ordinary
automobile plants did not have the skill to produce the Liberty
engine parts successfully. Consequently it became necessary to educate
thousands of mechanics, men and women alike, to do this new
work.</p>

<p>It was surprising to what extent unfriendly influence in the United
States, much of it probably of a pro-German character, cut a figure
in the situation. This was particularly true in the supply factories
furnishing tools to the Liberty engine plants. Approximately 85 per
cent of the tools first delivered for this work were found to be inaccurate
and incorrect. These had to be remade before they could be
used. Such tools as were delivered to the Liberty plants would
mysteriously disappear, or vital equipment would be injured in
unusual ways; in several instances cans of explosives were found in
the coal at power plants; fire-extinguishing apparatus was discovered
to be rendered useless by acts of depredation; and from numerous
other evidences the builders of Liberty engines were aware that
the enemy had his agents in their plants.</p>

<p>Difficulty was also experienced in the production of metals for the
new engines. The materials demanded were frequently of a much
higher grade than the corresponding materials used in ordinary automobile
motors. Here was another unseen phase of development
which had to be worked out patiently by the producers of raw
materials.</p>

<p>Difficulties in transportation during the winter of 1917-18 added
their share to the perplexing problems of the engine builders, while
at times the scarcity of coal threatened the complete shutdown of
some of the plants.</p>

<p>Under such obstacles the engine-production department forced the
manufacture of the Liberty engine at a speed never before known
in the automotive industry. In December, 1917, the Government
received the first 22 Liberty engines of the 12-cylinder type, durable
and dependable, a standardized, concrete product, only seven months
after the Liberty engine existed merely as an idea in the brains of
two engineers. These first engines developed a strength of approximately
330 horsepower, and this was true also of the first 300 Liberty
engines delivered, these deliveries being completed in the early spring
of 1918.</p>

<p>When the Liberty engine was designed our aviation experts believed
that 330 horsepower was so far in advance of the development of
aero engines in Europe that we could safely go ahead with the production
of this type on a quantity basis. But again we reckoned
without an accurate prophetic knowledge of the course of engine
development abroad. We were building the first 300 Liberty engines
at 330 horsepower when our aviation reports informed us from overseas
that an even higher horsepower would be desirable. Therefore
our engineers "stepped up" the power of the Liberty 12-cylinder
engine to 375 horsepower. Several hundred motors of this power
were in process of completion when again our observers in France
advised us that we could add another 25 horsepower to the Liberty,
making it 400 horsepower in strength, and be sure of leading all of
the combatant nations in size and power of aviation engines during
1918 and 1919. This last step, we were assured, was the final, definite
one. But to anticipate possible extraordinary development of engines
by other nations, our engineers went even further than the mark
advised by our overseas observers and raised the power of the Liberty
engine to something in excess of 400 horsepower.</p>

<p>This enormous increase over the original power of the Liberty
engine required changes in the construction, notably in increasing
the strength of practically all of the working parts, including the
crank shaft, the connecting rods, and the bearings. The change also
resulted in making scrap iron of a large quantity of the jigs and special
tools employed in making the lighter engines. A still further change
had to come in the character of some of the steel used in some of the
parts, and this went back to the smelting plants, where new and better
methods of producing steel and aluminum for the Liberty engine
had to be developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus while there were no fundamental changes in the design of the
engine, the increase of its power required a considerable readjustment
in the engine plants. Yet so rapidly were these changes made that
on the first anniversary of the day when the design of the Liberty
engine was begun&mdash;May 29, 1918&mdash;the Signal Corps had received
1,243 Liberty engines. In this achievement motor history was
written in this country as it had never been written before.</p>

<p>From a popular standpoint it may seem that the Liberty engine
was radically changed after its inception, but such an assertion is
entirely unwarranted; for in the fundamental thing, the design,
there was but one change made after the engine was laid down on
paper in May, 1917, namely, in the oiling system. The original
Liberty engine was partially fed with oil by the so-called scupper
system, whereas this later was changed to a forced feed under compression.
The scupper feed worked successfully, but the forced feed
is foolproof and was therefore installed upon the advice of the preponderance
of expert criticism.</p>

<p>It is also true that in working out certain practical manufacturing
processes some of the original measurements were altered. But this
is a common experience in the manufacture of any internal-combustion
engine, and alterations made for factory expediency are not
regarded as design changes, nor are they important.</p>

<p>The delivery of 22 motors in December of 1917 was followed by
the completion of 40 in January, 1918. In February the delivery was
70. In March this jumped to 122; then a leap in April to 415; while
in May deliveries amounted to 620.</p>

<p>The quantity production of Liberties may be said to have started
in June, 1918, one year after the engine's conception in Washington.
In that month 1,102 motors of the most powerful type were delivered
to the service. In July the figure was 1,589; in August, 2,297; in
September, 2,362. Then in October came an enormous increase to the
total of 3,878 Liberty engines. During the month before the armistice
was signed the engine factories were producing 150 engines a day.</p>

<p>In all, up to November 29, 1918, 15,572 Liberty engines were
produced in the United States. In the disposal of them the American
Navy received 3,742 for its seaplanes; the plants manufacturing
airplanes in this country took 5,323 of them; 907 were sent to various
aviation fields for training purposes; to the American Expeditionary
Forces in France, in addition to the engines which went over installed
in their planes, we sent 4,511 Liberty engines; while 1,089 went to the
British, French, and Italian air services.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest Liberties were sent to Europe. In January,
1918, we shipped 3 to our own forces in France. In March we sent
10 to the British, 6 to the French, and 5 to the Italians. By June 7
the English tests had convinced the British air minister that the
Liberty engine was in the first line of high powered aviation engines
and a most valuable contribution to the allied aviation program.
The British air minister so cabled to Lord Reading, the British
ambassador in Washington. Again on September 26 the British air
ministry reported that in identical airplanes the Liberty engine
performed at least as well as the Rolls-Royce engine. Birkight, who
designed the Hispano-Suiza engine in France, declared that the Liberty
engine was superior to any high-powered aviation engine then
developed on the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>A more concrete evidence of the esteem in which this American
creation was held by the European expert lies in the size of the orders
which the various allied Governments placed with the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
for Liberty engines. The British took 1,000 of them immediately
and declared that they wished to increase this order to 5,500 to be
delivered by December 31, 1918. The French directed inquiries as
to the possibility of taking one-fifth of our complete output of Liberty
engines. The Italians also indicated their intention of purchasing
heavily for immediate delivery.</p>

<p>This increased demand for the engine had not been anticipated
in our original plans, as we had no idea that the allied Governments
would turn from their own highly developed engines to ask for Liberty
engines in such quantities. The original program of 22,500 engines
was only sufficient for our own Army and Navy requirements. As
soon as the foreign Governments, however, came in with their
demands we immediately increased the orders placed with all the
existing Liberty engine builders, and in addition contracted to take
the entire manufacturing facilities of the Willys-Overland Co. at
its plants in Toledo and Elyria, Ohio, and Elmira, N. Y. We also
engaged the entire capacity of the Olds Motor plant at Lansing,
Mich. In addition we had subsequently contracted for the production
of 8,000 of the 8-cylinder engines. Thus the number of
engines which would have been delivered under contract, if peace
had not cut short the production, would have been 56,100 engines of
the 12-cylinder type and 8,000 of the 8's.</p>

<p>The foreign Governments associated with us in the war against
Germany showered their demands upon us for great numbers of the
American engines, not only altogether because of the excellence of
the Liberty, but because partially their plane production exceeded
their output of engines. Mr. John D. Ryan, Director of Aircraft
Production, verbally agreed to deliver to the French 1,500 Liberty
engines by December 31, and further agreed to deliver motors to the
French at the rate of 750 per month during the first six months of
1919. The British had already received 1,000 Liberty motors, and
this order was increased with Mr. Ryan personally by several thousand
additional engines to be delivered in the early part of 1919.
When the armistice was signed the Liberty engine was being produced
at a rate which promised to make it the dominant motive power of
the war in the air before many months had passed.</p>

<p>The engine was originally named the "United States Standard
12-cylinder Aviation Engine." In view of the service which it promised
to render to the cause of civilization, Admiral D. W. Taylor, the
chief construction officer of the Navy, suggested during the early part
of the period of production that the original prosaic name be discarded
and that the engine be rechristened the "Liberty." Under
this name the engine has taken its place in the history of the war as
one of the most efficient agencies which was developed and employed
by this country.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

OTHER AIRPLANE ENGINES.</h3>


<p>The production of the Liberty engine so captured popular attention
that the public never fairly understood nor appreciated the extent
of another production enterprise on the part of those providing
motive power for our war airplanes. This was the supplementary
manufacture of aero engines other than those which bore the proud
appellation of "Liberty."</p>

<p>Let the production figures speak for themselves. In those 19
months, starting with nothing, we turned out complete and ready for
service 32,420 aero engines. Of these thousands of engines less than
one-half&mdash;the exact figure being 15,572&mdash;were Liberty engines.
The rest were Hispano-Suizas, Le Rhones, Gnomes, Curtisses,
Hall-Scotts, and some others, a total of 16,848 in all&mdash;built largely
for the training of our army of the air.</p>

<p>This production would have been even more notable had the war
continued, for at the date of the signing of the armistice the United
States had contracted for the construction of 100,993 aircraft engines.
Of these 64,100 were to be Liberty engines, so that the total plan of
construction of engines other than the Liberty would have produced
about 37,000 of them. The total cost of carrying through the combined
engine project would have been in the neighborhood of
$450,000,000.</p>

<p>While at the outbreak of the war American knowledge of military
aviation may have been meager, still it was evident from
the start that we would be able to go ahead with certain phases of
production on a huge scale without waiting for the precise knowledge
of requirements that would come only from an exhaustive study of
the subject in Europe. In the first place we knew that we must
train our aviators. For this purpose there was at the start no particular
need of the highly-developed machinery then in use on the
western front. The first aircraft requirement of the early training
program was for safe planes, regardless of their type, and motive
power to drive them. Later on, when we were better prepared, would
come the training that would afford our aviators experience with
the fighting equipment. So at the start there was no reason why
we should not proceed at once with the construction of such training
machines as we knew how to build.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>An aviation program for war falls into these two divisions&mdash;the
equipment required for training and that required for combat.
While our organization, particularly through the Bolling commission
which we had sent to Europe, was making a study of our combat
requirements and while we were pushing forward the design and
production of the Liberty engine, we forthwith developed on an
ambitious scale the manufacture of training planes and engines in
this country.</p>

<p>The training of battle aviators, on the other hand, also separates
into two parts, the elementary training and the advanced training.
The elementary training merely teaches the cadet the new art of
maintaining himself in the air. Later, when he has mastered the
rudiments of mechanical flight, he goes into the advanced training,
the training in his fighting plane, where he requires equipment more
nearly of the type used at the front.</p>

<p>For the elementary training we had some good native material to
start with. The Curtiss Airplane Co. had been building training
planes and engines both for the English and Canadian air authorities.
This was evidently the most available American airplane for our
first needs. The Curtiss plane was known as the "JN-4" and it was
driven by a 90-horsepower engine called the Curtiss "OX." In the
production of this equipment on the scale planned by the Signal
Corps, the embarrassing feature, the choke point, was evidently
to be the manufacture of the engine. The Curtiss plant at Buffalo
for the manufacture of planes could be quickly expanded to meet
the Government demands; but the Curtiss engine plant at Hammondsport,
N. Y., could not develop the production of "OX" engines up
to our needs and at the same time complete the orders which it was
filling for the English and Canadian air services.</p>

<p>Consequently, contracts were awarded to the Curtiss Co. for its
capacity in the production of "OX" engines, and then the American
aviation authorities came to an agreement with the Willys-Morrow
plant at Elmira, N. Y., for an additional 5,000 of these motors.
Ordinarily it would require from five to six months to equip a plant
with the large machine tools and the smaller mechanical appliances
necessary for such a contract as this. But the Willys-Morrow plant
tooled up in three months and was ready to start on the "OX"
manufacturing job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>If speed in production was required at any point in the aviation
development it was here in the manufacture of the elementary training
planes and engines. Without training material, no matter how
many aviation fields we set in order nor how many student aviators
we enlisted, the movement of our flying forces toward the front could
not even begin. And here entered an interesting engineering and
executive problem that had to be worked out quickly by those in
charge of our aircraft construction. If it were plotted on paper, the
curve of requirements for aircraft training material would climb
swiftly to its peak during the first six or eight months of the war and
then decline with almost equal swiftness until it reached a low level.
In other words, we must produce the great number of training machines
in the shortest time possible in order to put our thousands of
student aviators into the air at once over the training fields; but when
this training equipment had been brought up to initial requirements,
thereafter our needs in this direction could be met by only a small
production, since the rate of wastage of such material is relatively
low. Once our fields were fully equipped, the same apparatus could
be used over and over again as the war went on, with little regard to
the improvements of the type of battle planes, so that the ultimate
manufacture need be large enough only to keep this equipment in
condition.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the production of Curtiss planes and
engines, even under the heavy contracts immediately placed, would
not be sufficient to take care of our elementary training needs; and
the aviation administration began looking around for other types of
aircraft that would fit into our plans. The experts in all branches
of war flying which the principal allied nations had sent to the United
States, warned us against the temptation to adopt many types of
material in order to secure a quick early production. If the training
equipment were not closely standardized in types, it would result in
confusion and delay, both in training the aviator to fly and in preparing
him for actual combat. Such had been the experience in
Europe; and we were now given the benefit of this experience, so
that we might avoid the mistakes which others had made. We were
advised to adopt a single type of equipment for each class of training;
but if that were not consistent with the demands for speed in getting
our service in the air, then at the most we should not have more than
two types either of planes or engines.</p>

<p>In the elementary training program it was evident that we could
not equip ourselves with a single type of plane, except at considerable
expense in time. Consequently we went ahead to develop another.</p>

<p>We found a training airplane being produced by the Standard
Aero Corporation and known as the "Standard-J." The company
had been developing this machine for approximately a year,
and its plant could be expanded readily to meet a large contract.
For the engine to drive this plane we adopted the Hall-Scott "A7A."
This was a four-cylinder engine. It had the fault of vibration common
to any four-cylinder engine, but it was regarded otherwise by experts
as a rugged and dependable piece of machinery. The Hall-Scott Co.
was equipped to produce this motor on an extensive scale, since at
the time this concern was probably the largest manufacturer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
aviation engines in the United States, with the possible exception of
the Curtiss Co. The engine had been used in airplanes built by the
Standard Aero Corporation, the Aero Marine Co., and the Dayton-Wright
Co. Therefore the Joint Army and Navy Technical Board
recommended the Standard-J plane and the Hall-Scott A7A engine
as the elementary training equipment to alternate with the Curtiss
plane and engine.</p>

<p>The Government placed contracts with the Hall-Scott Co. for 1,250
engines, its capacity. But, since a large additional number would
be required, a supplementary contract for 1,000 A7A's was given to
the Nordyke &amp; Marmon Co. The Hall-Scott Co. cooperated with
this latter concern by furnishing complete drawings, tools, and other
production necessities.</p>

<p>When it came to the advanced training for our aviators, more
highly developed mechanical equipment was required. There
must be two sorts of this equipment. The advanced student must
become acquainted with rotary engines such as were used by the
French and others to drive the small, speedy chass&eacute; planes, while
he must also come to be familiar with the operation of fixed cylinder
engines, possessing upwards of 100 horsepower. These latter were
the engines in commonest use on observation and bombing planes.
For each type, the rotary and fixed, we were permitted by our
policy to have two sorts of engines in order to get into production
as quickly as possible, but not more than two.</p>

<p>Here again we had to survey the field of engine manufacture and
select closely, at the same time making in point of speed approximately
as good a showing as if we had adopted every engine with
claims for our consideration and had told manufacturers of them
to produce as many as they could.</p>

<p>In this case of rotary engines, our aviation representatives in
Europe advised the production here of Gnome and Le Rhone motors.
There were two models of the Gnome engine, one developing 110
horsepower and the other 150. The Le Rhone engine produced
80 horsepower. The Bolling commission had recommended that the
Gnome 150 be used in some of our combat planes.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 we were producing a few Gnome 110 horsepower
engines in this country. The General Vehicle Co. at some
time previously had taken a foreign order for these engines. But
neither the Gnome 150 nor the Le Rhone 80 had been built in the
United States, both of these having been developed and used exclusively
in France. The first recommendations from our observers
in France advised us to produce 5,000 of the more powerful Gnome
150's and 2,500 Le Rhone 80's.</p>

<p>The production of Gnome engines in this country forms a good
illustration of the manner in which aircraft requirements at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
front were constantly shifting, due to the rapid evolution of the
science of mechanical flight. Our officers did not hesitate to overrule
their previous decisions, if such a course seemed to be justified,
even at the cost of rendering useless great quantities of work already
done and material already produced. This has been shown in the
case of the Liberty engine. At the start we set out to build Liberty
8-cylinder engines on a large scale, only to discontinue this work
before it was fairly started; but later on we again took up a Liberty
8-cylinder project on almost as great a scale as had been planned
originally.</p>

<p>So with the production of the heavy 150-horsepower Gnome
engine. Our European advisors were first of the opinion that we
should go heavily into this production. Consequently the equipment
end of the Signal Corps projected a program of 5,000 of the large
Gnome engines. Such a contract was entirely beyond the capacity
of the General Vehicle Co., which had been building the lighter
Gnomes. So the Government entered into negotiations with the
General Motors Co. to assume the greater burden of this undertaking.
Under the pilotage of the aircraft authorities, an agreement
was reached for the industrial combination of the General Motors
Co. and the General Vehicle Co. The former concern brought its
vast resources and numerous factories into the consolidation; while
the latter furnished the only skilled knowledge and experience
there was in the United States in the art of making rotary engines.
This seemed to be a great step in our progress and an achievement
in itself; but just as the undertaking of the construction of large
Gnome engines was about to be started, events in Europe had caused
our observers there to revise their first judgment, and we received
cabled instructions recommending that we discontinue the development
of the Gnome 150.</p>

<p>The entire program for Gnome 150's was canceled, and thereafter
the General Vehicle Co., with its relatively small capacity, was called
upon to produce as many of the small Gnome 110's as it could. As
a matter of record the production of these engines amounted to 280
in number.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps found it difficult to induce manufacturers in this
country to undertake the construction of foreign designed engines at
all. The plans and specifications of mechanical appliances furnished
by foreign engineers and manufacturers are so different from ours
that trouble is invariably experienced in attempts to use them here.
Successful concerns in this country naturally hesitated to pick up
contracts on which they might fail and thus tarnish their reputations.
Our advisors in Europe were insistent that we should produce Le
Rhone engines in quantity in the United States, yet it was hard to
find any manufacturing concern willing to undertake such a develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>ment.
Nevertheless, the production of Le Rhone engines proved to
be one of the most successful phases of the whole aircraft program.
Its story illustrates the obstacles encountered in adapting a foreign
device to American manufacture, and it also shows how American
production genius can overcome these handicaps.</p>

<p>It was only after strenuous efforts on our part that the Union
Switch &amp; Signal Co., of Swissvale, Pa., a member of the Westinghouse
chain of factories, was induced to take up the Le Rhone contract.
This project called for the production of 2,500 rotary Le Rhones of
80 horsepower each. Let us see how the manufacturers took this
totally unfamiliar machine and went about it to reproduce it in this
country.</p>

<p>One might think that it would be necessary only to take the French
drawings, change the metric system measurements to our own scale
of feet and inches, and proceed to turn out the mechanism. But
it was not so simple as that. We did receive the drawings, the specifications,
the metallurgical instructions and the like, but these we
found to be unreliable and unsatisfactory from our point of view.
For instance, according to the French instructions the metallurgical
requirements for the engine crank-shaft called for mild steel. This
was obviously incorrect; and if an error had crept into this part of
the plans there was no telling how faulty the rest of them might be.
So from the metallurgical standpoint alone this became a laboratory
job of analysis and investigation. A sample engine had been sent
to us from France. Every piece of metal in this engine was examined
by the chemists to determine its proper constituents, and from
this original investigation new specifications were made for the steel
producers.</p>

<p>The drawings of the engine were quite unsatisfactory from the
point of view of American mechanics. They were found to be
incorrect, and there were not enough of them. Consequently this
required another study on the part of engineers and a new set of
drawings to be made up. All of this fundamental work monopolized
the time of a large force of draughtsmen and engineers for several
months, working under the direction of E. J. Hall and Frank M.
Hawley. The engine could not be successfully built without this
preliminary study, yet this is a part of manufacture of which the
uninitiated have little knowledge.</p>

<p>The production of the Le Rhone engine might have been materially
delayed by these difficulties, except for the organizing ability of the
executives handling the contract. While the metallurgists were
specifying the steel of the engine parts and the engineers were drafting
correct plans, the factory officials, with the assistance of the
engine production division of the Air Service, were procuring machinery
and tooling up the plant for the forthcoming effort. By the
time this equipment was installed the plans were ready, the steel
mills were producing the proper qualities of metal, and all was
ready for the effort. The Gnome-Le Rhone factories in France sent
one of their best engineers, M. Georges Guillot, and he assisted in
the work at the Union Switch &amp; Signal Co. So rapidly was the whole
development carried out that the first American Le Rhones were
delivered to the Government in May, 1918, considerably less than a
year after the project was assumed by the Union Switch &amp; Signal
Co., which concern had not received the plans of the engine until
September, 1917. By the time the armistice was signed the company
had delivered 1,057 Le Rhone engines. Subsequent contracts had
increased the original order to 3,900 Le Rhones, all of which would
have been delivered before the summer of 1919, had the coming of
peace not terminated the manufacture. Although France is the home
of the rotary aviation engine, M. Guillot has certified to the Aircraft
Board that these American Le Rhones were the best rotary engines
ever built.</p>

<p>When it came to the selection of fixed cylinder engines for our
advanced training program, all of the indications pointed to a single
one, the Hispano-Suiza engine of 150 horsepower. This was a tried
and true engine of the war, tested by a wealth of experience and found
dependable. France had used the engine extensively in both its
training and combat planes. In 1916 it had been brought to the
United States for production for the allies, and when we entered the
war the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation was producing Hispano-Suizas
in small quantity. By the early summer of 1917, however,
the motor had fallen behind in the development of combat engines
because of the increasing horsepowers demanded by the fighting
aces on the front, but it was still a desirable training engine and
could, if necessary, be used to a limited extent in planes at the front.</p>

<p>The plane adopted by the American aircraft authorities for this
type of advanced training was known as the Curtiss "JN 4H." It
was readily adapted for the use of the Hispano-Suiza 150-horsepower
engine. Contracts for several thousand of these engines were placed
with the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation, and up to the signing
of the armistice 3,435 engines were delivered. Before we could start
the production of this engine it was necessary for the Government
to arrange with the Hispano-Suiza Co. for the American rights to
build it, this arrangement including the payment of royalties. Incidentally
it is interesting to note that royalty was the chief beneficiary
of the royalties paid by the American Government, King Alfonso of
Spain being the heaviest stockholder of the Hispano-Suiza Co.</p>

<p>Although our policy permitted us to produce a second training
engine of the fixed cylinder type, no engine other than the Hispano-Suiza
was taken up by us. A number presented their claims for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
consideration, but they were one and all rejected. Among these were
the Curtiss engines "OXX" and "V." A few of both of these had
been used by the Navy, but neither one seemed to the Signal Corps
to meet the requirements. The Sturtevant Co. had developed a
135-horsepower engine and built a few of them, while Thomas Bros.,
at Ithaca, N. Y., had taken the Sturtevant engine and modified it
in a way that they claimed improved it, although the changes had
not substantially increased the horsepower. This engine was rejected
on the ground that it was too low in horsepower to endure as a useful
machine through any considerable period of manufacture, and also
because it was too heavy per horsepower to accomplish the best
results.</p>

<p>To sum it up, our training program was built around the above
named engines&mdash;the Curtiss "OX" and the Hall-Scott "A7A" for
the elementary training machines; the Gnome and Le Rhone, for the
rotary engine types of planes in the advanced training; and the
Hispano-Suiza 150-horsepower, for the advanced training in fixed-cylinder-engine
machines. Between the dates of September 1, 1917,
and December 19, 1918, we sent to 27 fields 13,250 cadets and 9,075
students for advanced training. They flew a total of 888,405 hours
and suffered 304 fatalities, or an average of 1 fatality for every
2,922.38 flying hours. At one field the training fliers were in the air
19,484 hours before there was 1 fatality; another field increased this
record to 20,269 hours; while a third made the extraordinary record
of 1 casualty in 30,982 flying hours.</p>

<p>Although we do not possess the actual statistics, the best unofficial
figures show that the British averaged 1 fatality for each 1,000 flying
hours at their training camps, the French 1 for each 900 flying hours,
while the Italian training killed 1 student for each 700 flying hours.
These figures are significant, although varying conditions in the types
of training programs may account to some extent for the wide differences
in numbers of casualties at American as compared with allied
training camps.</p>

<p>But while we were producing engines for the training airplanes,
both elementary and advanced, we were not staking our whole
combat program on the Liberty engine alone, although we expected
that engine to be our main reliance in our battle machines. Our
organization, both at home and abroad, was on the alert continually
for other engines that might be produced in Europe or the United
States and which would be so far in advance of anything in use by
the air fighters in Europe in 1917 as to justify our production of them
on a considerable scale. One of these motors which seemed to
promise great results for the future was the Rolls-Royce, which had
even then, in 1917, taken its place at the head of the British airplane
engines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced in reaching a satisfactory
arrangement with the Rolls-Royce Co. We expected to duplicate
this engine at the plant of the Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co., at Buffalo,
N. Y., but the British concern objected to this arrangement on the
ground that the Pierce-Arrow people were commercial competitors.</p>

<p>It was several months before we could agree on a factory and arrive
at a contract satisfactory to both sides. Meanwhile the Liberty
engine had scored its great success, and the expected enormous
production of Liberties tended to cool the enthusiasm of our aircraft
authorities for the Rolls-Royce, as it was evident that the Liberty
itself would be as serviceable and as advanced in type as the British
product.</p>

<p>The Rolls-Royce Co. wished to manufacture here its "190," an
engine developing from 250 to 270 horsepower; and for this effort
it was prepared to send to the United States at once a complete set
of jigs, gauges, and all other necessary tooling of a Rolls-Royce
plant. With this equipment ready at hand the company expected
to produce about 500 American-built Rolls-Royce engines before the
1st of July, 1918.</p>

<p>But so rapidly was the evolution of aircraft engines going ahead
that even during the time of these negotiations it became evident
that something more than 250 horsepower would soon be needed in
the fighting planes on the Western front. We therefore abandoned
the Rolls-Royce model 190 and started negotiations for the 270-horsepower
engine, the latest and most powerful one produced by
the Rolls-Royce Co. But for this engine the British concern could
not furnish the tooling, which would have to be made new in this
country, and this would reduce the schedule of deliveries. As a
result no American-built Rolls-Royce engine was ever made.</p>

<p>Another disappointing experience in attempting to produce a
foreign designed motor in this country was the project to bring the
manufacture of Bugatti engines to the United States. When our
European aircraft commission arrived in France, the first experimental
Bugatti engine had just made its appearance. It was apparently
a long step in advance of any other motor that had been
produced. This French mechanism was a geared 16-cylinder engine.
It weighed approximately 1,100 pounds and was expected to develop
510 horsepower. It seemed to be the motor to supplement our own
Liberty engine construction. Although heavier than a Liberty, it
was much more powerful. The first Bugatti engine built in France
was purchased by the Bolling commission and hurried to the United
States with the urgent recommendation that we put it into production
immediately and push its manufacture as energetically as we
were pushing that of the Liberty engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The Signal Corps acted immediately upon this advice and prepared
to proceed with the Bugatti on a scale that promised to make its
development as spectacular as that of the Liberty. The Duesenberg
Motor Corporation, of Elizabeth, N. J., was even then tooling up for
the production of Liberty engines. We took this concern from its
Liberty work and directed it to assume leadership in the production
of Bugattis. The Liberty engine construction had been centered
in the Detroit district. We now prepared to establish a new aviation
engine district in the East, associating in it such concerns as the
Fiat Plant at Schenectady, N. Y., the Herschell-Spillman Co., of
North Tonawanda, N. Y., and several others. For a time the
expectation for the Bugatti production ran almost as high as the
enthusiasm for the Liberty engine, but the whole undertaking ended
virtually in failure, a failure again due to the tremendous difficulty
in adapting foreign engineering plans to American factory production.</p>

<p>This was the story of it. In due time the sample Bugatti engine
arrived, and with it were several French engineers and expert mechanics.
But, once set up, the Bugatti motor would not function, nor was
it in condition to run; for, as we discovered, during its test in France
a soldier had been struck by its flying propeller. His body had been
thrown twice to the roof of the testing shed, and the shocks had
bent the engine's crank shaft. Then, too, we learned for the first
time that the design and development of this engine had not been
carried through to completion and that a great deal of work would
be required before the device could be put into manufacture. The
tests in France had developed that such a fundamental feature as the
oiling system needed complete readjustment, and this was only indicative
of the amount of work yet to be done on the engineering
side of the production. We did our best with this engine; but to
redesign it and develop it so that it could pass the severe 50-hour
test demanded by our Joint Army and Navy Technical Board was the
work of months, and after that the tooling up of plants had to be
accomplished. The American Bugatti was just getting into production
when the armistice was signed, a total of only 11 having been
delivered.</p>

<p>As we have seen, we were already building several hundred Hispano-Suiza
150-horsepower engines for our training planes. Soon
after the arrival of our aircraft commission in France we were advised
to go into the additional manufacture of the latest Hispano-Suiza
geared engine of 220-horsepower. Consequently the Washington
office at once arranged with the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation,
which was building the smaller Hispano-Suizas, to undertake the
production of this newer model also. The preparations for this
manufacture had gone on in the Wright-Martin plant for a considerable
period of time when further advice from Europe informed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
that the Hispano-Suiza 220 was not performing successfully on account
of trouble with the gearing. This fact, of course, canceled the new
contract with the Wright-Martin Co., the incident being another of
those ups and downs with which the undertaking was replete.</p>

<p>Along in the summer of 1918 the Hispano-Suiza designers in
Europe brought out a 300-horsepower engine. By this date the
development of military flying had made it apparent that engines of
such great horsepower could be used advantageously on the smaller
planes. However, the engine plants of the allied countries were
already taxed to their capacities by their existing contracts, and the
demands of these countries for high-powered engines could not be
supplied unless we in America could increase our manufacturing
facilities even further.</p>

<p>In following out this ambition, we placed contracts for the production
of 10,000 Hispano-Suiza 300-horsepower engines. Of these,
5,000 were to be built by the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation.
To enable this company to fulfill the new contract we leased to
it the plant owned by the Government in Long Island City
which had formerly been owned by the General Vehicle Co. The
other 5,000 of these engines were to be built by the Pierce-Arrow
Motor Car Co. at Buffalo. We also contracted for the entire manufacturing
facilities of the H. H. Franklin Co., of Syracuse, N. Y.,
to aid both the Wright-Martin Corporation and the Pierce-Arrow
Co., in this contract. The first of these high-powered Hispano-Suiza
engines were expected to be delivered in January, 1919, but
this project, of course, was interrupted by the armistice.</p>

<p>To summarize the complete engine program of the aviation development,
the total contracts for engines provided for the delivery of
100,993 engines. These were divided as follows:</p>

<p>At the signing of the armistice the United States had produced
about one-third of the engines projected in its complete aviation
program.</p>

<p>Of the output of training engines to November 29, 1918, the various
airplane plants took 9,069 for installation in planes, 325 (all of these
being Le Rhone rotaries) went to the American Expeditionary
Forces in France, 515 (all of which were Hispano-Suizas) were taken
by the Navy, a single A7A model was sent to one of the allied countries,
while 6,376 engines were sent directly to the training fields.</p>

<p>Of the combat engines produced to November 29, 1918 (which
classification includes all of the Liberties, the two more powerful
types of the Hispano-Suiza, and the Bugatti engine), 5,327 went to
the various airplane plants for installation in planes, 5,030 of them
were sent directly to the American Expeditionary Forces, 3,746 were
turned over to the Navy, 1,090 went to the several allied nations, and
941 were taken by the training fields.</p>

<p>The shipment of aviation engines to Europe, however, does not
imply the immediate use of them by our airplane squadrons at the
front. In this report shipment to the American Expeditionary
Forces means the shipment of engines from the American factories
producing them. As a matter of fact several months usually elapsed
from the dispatch of an engine from an American shop until it actually
reached the Air Service in France, and even then another month
might be required to put the engine into actual service. As a result,
of the 5,000 and more aviation engines sent to France by the American
engine producers, outside of those installed in their planes, less than
3,000 are recorded in the annals of the American Expeditionary
Forces as having been received by them up to the end of December,
1918, the missing 2,000 being in that period either somewhere in
transit or in warehouses on the route to their destination.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note what makes of foreign engines were used
by our airmen in the war operations. An appended table shows the
list of those received, their names, their rated powers, the numbers
received month by month, and the totals. The records of the
American Expeditionary Forces show that the squadrons in all
received from all sources 4,715 aviation engines up to the end of the
year 1918, but it should be borne in mind that this figure does not
include more than 2,000 engines, principally Liberties, recorded on
this side of the Atlantic as having been shipped to the Army abroad.
Of the 4,715 engines noted as received, 2,710 were Liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the foreign engines used by our pilots even approached
the Liberty in power. The nearest in power were a Renault and an
Hispano-Suiza, both rated at 300 horsepower.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

AVIATION EQUIPMENT AND ARMAMENT.</h3>


<p>On one of the early days in the great war a Russian aviator,
aloft in one of the primitive airplanes of that time, was engaged in
locating the positions of the enemy when he chanced upon a German
birdman engaged in a similar mission.</p>

<p>In those ancient times&mdash;for they seem ancient to us now, although
less than five years have elapsed&mdash;actual fighting in the air was
unknown. The aviators had no equipment for battle; indeed, it
was doubtful if the thought had occurred to either side to keep
down the enemy's aircraft by the use of armed force borne upon wings.
In the first months of aviation in the great war the fliers of both sides
recognized a sort of <i>noblesse oblige</i> of the air, which, if it did not make
for actual friendship or fraternizing between the rival air services,
at least amounted to a respect for each other often evidenced by an
innocuous waving of hands as hostile flying machines passed each
other.</p>

<p>But now the wounds of war had begun to smart; and when the
Russian saw the German flier going unhindered upon a work that
might bring death to thousands of soldiers in the Czar's army, a
sudden rage filled his heart, and he determined to bring down his
adversary, even at the cost of his own life. Maneuvering his craft,
presently he was flying directly beneath the German and in the same
direction and was but a short distance below his enemy's plane.
Then, with a pull on his control lever, the Russian shot his machine
sharply upward, hoping to upset the German and to escape himself.
The result was that the machines collided, and both crashed to the
ground. This was probably the first aerial combat of the war.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us to-day that the highly complicated and standardized
art of fighting with airplanes was developed entirely during
the great war and, indeed, was only started after the war had been in
progress for several months. Yet such was the case. At the beginning
of the war there was no such thing as armament in aircraft,
either of the offensive or defensive sort. It is true that a small
amount of experimentation in this direction had occurred prior to
the war and also in the early months of fighting, but it was not until
the summer of 1915 that air fighting, as it is so well known to the
entire world to-day, was begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>In this country we had successfully fired a machine gun from an
airplane in 1912, while at the beginning of the war the French had a
few heavy airplanes equipped to carry machine guns. Yet in August,
1915, Maj. Eric T. Bradley, of the United States Air Service, but then
a flight sublieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, frequently flew
over the lines hunting for Germans; and his offensive armament
consisted of a Lee-Enfield rifle or sometimes a 12-gauge double-barreled
shotgun.</p>

<p>The aviators in those pioneer days usually carried automatic
pistols, but the danger to one side or the other from such weapons
was slight, owing to the great difficulty of hitting an object moving as
swiftly as an airplane travels. The earlier planes also packed a
supply of trench grenades for dropping upon bodies of troops. Another
pioneer offensive weapon for the airplane was the steel dart, which
was dropped in quantities upon the enemy's trenches. Great numbers
of these darts were manufactured in the United States for the
allies, but the weapon proved to be so ineffective that it had but a
brief existence.</p>

<p>It is said that before the pilots carried any weapons at all the
first war aviators used to shoot at each other with Very pistols,
which projected Roman candle balls. The start of air fighting
may be said to have come when the Lewis machine guns were
brought out for use in the trenches. Presently these ground guns
were taken into the planes and fired from the observers' shoulders.
Then for the first time war flying began to be a hazardous occupation
so far as the enemy's attentions were concerned.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that the machine gun was the most effective
weapon of all for use on an airplane, because only with rapid firers
could one hope to hunt successfully such swiftly moving prey as
airplanes. It had become patent to the strategists that it was of
supreme importance to keep the enemy's aircraft on the ground.
Hence invention began adapting the machine gun to airplane use.</p>

<p>The swiftest planes of all were those of the single-seater pursuit
type. It was obviously impossible for the lone pilot of one of
these to drop his controls and fire a machine gun from his shoulder.
This necessitated a fixed gun that could be operated while the pilot
maintained complete control of his machine, and such necessity was
the mother of the invention known as the synchronizing gear.</p>

<p>This ingenious contrivance, however, did not come at once.
Most of the war planes were of the tractor type; that is, that they
had the engine and propeller in front, this arrangement giving them
better maneuvering and defensive powers in the air than those possessed
by planes with the rear, pushing propellers. The first fixed
machine gun was carried on the upper plane of the biplane so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
shoot over the arc described by the propeller. With the gun thus
attached parallel to the line of flight, the pilot needed only to point
the airplane itself directly at the target to have the gun trained on its
objective. But such an arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory.
A single belt or magazine of cartridges could, indeed, be fired from
the gun, but there was no more firing on that trip, because the pilot
could not reach up to the upper plane to reload the weapon.</p>

<p>So the fixed gun was brought down into the fuselage and made to
fire through the whirling propeller. At first the aviators took their
chances of hitting the propeller blades, and sometimes the blades
were armored at the point of fire, being sheathed in steel of a shape
calculated to cause the bullets to glance off. This system was
not satisfactory. Then, since a single bullet striking an unprotected
propeller blade would often shatter it to fragments, attempts were
made to wrap the butts of the blades in linen fabric to prevent this
splintering, and this protection actually allowed several shots to
pierce the propeller without breaking it.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs on both sides early in 1915. The French
Nieuports had their fixed guns literally shooting through the propellers,
the bullets perforating the blades, if they did not wreck them.
As late as February, 1917, Maj. Bradley, who was by that time a
flight commander in the British service, worked a Lewis gun over the
Bulgarian lines with the plane propellers protected only by cloth
wrappings.</p>

<p>All of this makeshift operation of fixed machine guns was
changed by the invention of the synchronizing device. This is an
appliance for controlling the fire of the fixed gun so that the bullets
miss the blades of the flying propeller and pass on in the infinitesimal
spaces of time when the line of fire ahead of the gun is clear of obstruction.
The term "synchronizing" is not accurate, since that word
implies that the gun fires after each passage of a propeller blade across
the trajectory. Such is not the truth. The propeller revolves much
more rapidly than the gun fires. The device is also called an "interrupter,"
another inexact term, since the fire of the gun is not interrupted,
but only caused at the proper moments. Technicians prefer
the name "gun control" for this mechanism.</p>

<p>Who first invented the synchronizer is a matter of dispute, but all
observers agree that the Germans in the Fokker monoplanes of 1915
were the first to use it extensively. Not until some time after this
did the allies generally install similar devices. Some have attributed
the original invention to the famous French flier, Roland Garros.</p>

<p>Two types of synchronizers were developed, one known as the
hydraulic type and the other as the mechanical. In operation they
are somewhat similar. In each case there is a cam mounted on the
engine shaft so that each impulse of the piston actuates a plunger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
The plunger passes on the impulses to the rest of the mechanism. In
the mechanical control the impulse is carried through a series of rods
to the gun, causing the latter to fire at the proper moments. In the
hydraulic control the impulse is transmitted through oil held at a
pressure in a system of copper tubes. The hydraulic synchronizer is
known as the Constantinisco control, commonly called the "C. C."
after the military fashion of using initials. This was the device
copied for American planes in the war.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, we knew practically nothing about the use or manufacture
of aircraft guns. We had used airplanes at the Mexican
border, but not one of them carried a machine gun. The Lewis gun,
which is a flexible type of aircraft weapon pointed on a universal
pivot by the observer in a two-place plane, was being manufactured
by the Savage Arms Corporation for the British Government; but we
had never made a gun of the fixed type in this country, nor did we
know anything about the construction or manufacture of synchronizers.</p>

<p>One special requirement of the aircraft machine gun is that it must
be reliable in the extreme. It is bad enough to have a gun jam on the
ground, but in the air it may be fatal, for little can be done there to
repair the weapon. A jam leaves the gunner to the mercy of his
adversary, so in the production of aircraft armament there must be
not only special care in the manufacture of the guns, but the ammunition,
too, must be as perfect as human accuracy can make it. The
cartridges must be either hand-picked and specially selected from the
run of service ammunition, or else manufactured slowly and expressly
for the purpose, with minute gauging from start to finish of the
process.</p>

<p>Another requirement for the aircraft gun is that it must function
perfectly in any position. On the ground a machine gun is fired
essentially in a horizontal position, but the airman dives and leaps
in his maneuvering and must be able to shoot at any instant.</p>

<p>Aircraft guns are subject to extreme variations of temperature,
and so they must be certain to function perfectly in the zero cold of
the high altitudes, regardless of the contraction of their metal parts.</p>

<p>Then, too, such guns must be able to fire at a much greater rate
than those of the ground service. Five hundred shots per minute is
regarded as sufficient for a ground gun, but aircraft guns have been
brought up to a rate of fire as high as 950 to 1,000 shots per minute.
The Browning aircraft gun, never used by us, but in process of development
when the armistice was signed, had been speeded up to
1,300 shots per minute, with all shots synchronized to miss the blades
of the propeller.</p>

<p>The rate of fire in the air can not be made too swift. Suppose an
airplane were flying past a long, stationary target, such as a billboard,
at the relatively slow speed of 100 miles an hour. Assume on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
this plane a flexible machine gun aimed at the billboard at right
angles to the line of flight. If this is a fast machine gun, it may
shoot 880 times a minute, at which rate the shots will come so fast that
the explosions will merge into a continuous roar. Yet the bullets
fired at such a rate from a machine moving at even such low speed
will be spaced out along the billboard at intervals of 10 feet. But
most of the fighting planes traveled much faster than 100 miles per
hour. Thus it is entirely possible for two antagonists in the air to
aim with complete accuracy at each other and both to pass unscathed
through the lines of fire. The faster, therefore, the aircraft gun
fired, the better the chances of bringing down the enemy plane.</p>

<p>The Lewis gun, invented by Col. Lewis, of the United States Army,
was the weapon most generally used by the allies as the flexible gun
for their airplanes, operated on a universal mount which permitted
it to be pointed in any direction. The Lewis aircraft gun was the
ground gun modified principally by stripping it of the cooling radiator
and by the addition of a gas check to reduce the recoil. The Lewis
was fed by a drum magazine, a more desirable feed for flexible guns
than any belt system. The German flexible gun, the Parabellum, had
the unsatisfactory belt feed.</p>

<p>The Vickers gun was the only successful weapon of the fixed type
developed in the war before we became a belligerent. We were
manufacturing Vickers guns in the United States prior to April, 1917;
but when the Signal Corps faced the machine-gun problem, in September,
1917, it found that the Infantry branches of the Army had
contracted for the entire Vickers production in this country.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the equipment division of the Signal Corps, in the face
of marked opposition, took up the development of the Marlin gun as an
aircraft gun of the fixed type. This gun, however, proved to be
extraordinarily successful and was regarded by our Flying Service
and by the aviators of the allies to be the equal of the Vickers in
efficiency. Because of this development, when there came the need
of tank guns, in June, 1918, the Aircraft Board, which had succeeded
the Signal Corps as the director of aerial activities, was able to supply
7,220 Marlin machine guns within two weeks for this purpose.</p>

<p>The first order for Marlin guns was placed on September 25, 1917;
and over 37,500 of them had been produced before December, 1918.
The Marlin-Rockwell factory began producing 2,000 guns per month
in January, 1918, and increased this rapidly until as many as 7,000
guns were built in one month. The Marlin gun shoots at the rate of
600 to 650 shots per minute and is fed by a belt of the disintegrating
metal-link type.</p>

<p>As to Lewis guns, which we adopted as our flexible weapon,
more than 35,000 of them were delivered to the Air Service up to
December, 1918. In February, 1918, the Savage Arms Corporation
built 1,500 of them, increasing their monthly deliveries until in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
month of October, 1918, they turned out 5,448 of these weapons. The
Lewis gun which the British had been using carried 47 cartridges in
its magazine. A notable accomplishment of the manufacture of
Lewis guns for our use was to increase the capacity of the magazine
to hold 97 cartridges.</p>

<p>In our De Haviland-4 planes we installed two Marlin fixed guns,
each firing at the rate of 650 shots per minute, equipping the weapons
with Constantinisco controls to give the plane a maximum fire of
1,300 shots per minute through the blades of a propeller whirling at
a rate as high as 1,600 revolutions per minute. Four fixed guns have
also been successfully fitted to one plane and timed so that none of the
bullets struck the propeller blades.</p>

<p>At the time the armistice was signed the rate of production of special
aircraft ammunition, a classification including tracer bullets, incendiary
bullets, and armor-piercing bullets, exceeded 10,000,000 rounds
per month.</p>

<p>The original estimate for the quantity of ammunition our Flying
Service should have was later greatly increased because the squadrons
at the front began installing as many as four guns on a single
observation plane.</p>

<p>Although different aviators had their own notions about the
loading of ammunition belts, certain sequences in the use of the three
types of special ammunition were usually observed. First usually
came the tracer cartridge, which assists the gunner in directing his
aim; then two or three armor-piercing cartridges, relied upon to
injure the hostile engine or tap the gasoline tank; and finally one or
two incendiary cartridges to ignite the enemy's gasoline as it escaped,
sending him down in flames. Such a sequence would be repeated
throughout the ammunition belt or magazine container.</p>

<p>The belts for the fixed guns carry a maximum of 500 rounds of
cartridges. The belt which we furnished to our fliers at the front
was made of small metallic links fastened together by the cartridges
themselves. As the gun was fired and the cartridges ejected, the
links fell apart and cleared the machine through special chutes. The
total production of such belting in this country amounted to 59,044,755
links. Although the links are extremely simple in design, the
great accuracy required in their finish made production of them a
difficult manufacturing undertaking. The production and inspection
of each link involved over 36 separate operations. It actually cost
more to inspect belt links than to manufacture them.</p>

<p>We produced 12,621 British unit sights for airplane guns and sent
1,550 of them overseas. We also bought an adequate number of
small electric heaters to keep the gun oil from congealing in the cold
of high altitudes.</p>

<p>A novel undertaking for our photographic manufacturers was the
production of the so-called gun cameras which are used to train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
airplane gunners in accuracy of fire. Target practice with a machine
gun in an airplane is dangerous to the innocent bystander; and it
was found to be impracticable, moreover, to tow suitable targets
for actual machine-gun fire. Consequently, quite early in the war,
the air services of the allies adopted the practice of substituting
cameras for the machine guns on the practice planes.</p>

<p>One of these gun cameras, invented by Thornton Pickard, of Altringham,
England, imitated in design a Marlin aircraft machine gun;
and in order to make a picture with it, the gunner must go through
the same movements that he would employ in firing a Marlin gun.
Thus, if the gun were pointed directly on the target, the target
would appear squarely in the center of the picture taken; and this
showed the gunner's accuracy as well as if he had fired cartridges
from the actual weapon.</p>

<p>These gun cameras were of two sorts. One type took a single
picture each time the trigger was pulled. Those of the other sort
took a number of pictures automatically at a speed approximately
that of the firing of a machine gun. This latter type was much the
same as a moving picture camera, the resulting film being a string
of silhouettes of the target, each exposure showing whether the aim
of the gunner was exact at the instant the picture was taken.</p>

<p>In September, 1917, the Eastman Kodak Co. began the development
of a camera gun of the "burst" or automatic moving-picture
type. After our authorities had seen the model, the Navy ordered
a number of them, while the Air Service placed increasing orders for
these instruments until 1,057 had been produced and delivered to the
Government by November, 1918. This camera was not used in the
fixed airplane guns, but was designed to train the operators of the
flexible Lewis gun. The camera exactly replaced the ammunition
magazine on a Lewis gun.</p>

<p>Of the single-shot gun cameras 150 were delivered during the hostilities.
This design was obtained from Canada and duplicated here.</p>

<p>The use of the so-called Bromotype paper in gun cameras was
one of the interesting phases of this development. As everyone
acquainted with photography knows, a picture is made ordinarily
by exposing a sensitized plate or film, developing the latter to
make a negative, then exposing sensitive print paper to the light
that comes through the negative, thus reversing the lights and
shadows and creating a positive in the exact semblance of the subject
photographed. A concern in Cleveland, Ohio, the Positype Co.,
produced Bromotype paper which could be exposed directly in the
camera, coming out of the developing process as a positive without
the intervention of a film or plate negative.</p>

<p>Bromotype paper is much more highly sensitized than ordinary
print paper, so that it may be adequately exposed in an instantaneous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
high-speed snapshot. The exposure is then developed in the ordinary
way in the dark room, the familiar negative image appearing
on the surface in the ruby light of the lantern. At this point the
special developing process enters. The paper negative, without
being fixed, is immersed in a bath of chemicals that dissolves away
the sensitized surface that has been oxidized by the light from the
camera lens&mdash;that is, the image&mdash;leaving on the paper only the
unoxidized, or unexposed, parts of the sensitization. The paper
now presents an unbroken white surface. It is then redeveloped
by a special solution, and the picture in its true values of light and
shade thus comes into existence. The entire development and
finishing of this paper requires only 2&frac12; to 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Under this system, of course, only one finished print of each
exposure can be made; but the airplane gunners needed only one
print to show their aim. Positype paper was thus admirably
adapted for use in the airplane gun cameras; and because of its
cheapness and the simplicity and rapidity of its use, it was rapidly
supplanting film at the training camps in this country when the
armistice was signed.</p>


<h4>AIRPLANE BOMBS.</h4>

<p>The American production of bombs to be dropped from airplanes
was not started so soon as production in some of the other branches
of ordnance development, due to numerous difficulties encountered
in working up the design of this new mat&eacute;riel. Although aerial
bombing was steadily increasing in effectiveness and magnitude when
hostilities ended, yet this kind of fighting was a development that
came relatively late in the war; and the lack of perfected standards
at the time this country became a belligerent helped to impede our
program.</p>

<p>Some of the bombs first designed and put into production were
later rejected by our forces in France, as they had become obsolete
before being shipped overseas. We managed to manufacture a great
quantity of unloaded bombs by the time the armistice was signed,
enough, in fact, to provide for the Army's needs during another year
of warfare. These had to be loaded with explosives before they were
ready for use. We lacked adequate facilities for loading bombs with
explosives, although these facilities were being provided rapidly when
the war ended. The result was that the thousands of completed
American bombs remained unloaded, while practically all the bombs
used by our fliers in France were of foreign manufacture.</p>

<p>Military science had had some small experience with aerial bombing
prior to the great war. Italian aviators had dropped bombs of
an ineffective sort during Italy's war in Africa. When Mexico was
having a civil war in 1914 American air-sailors of fortune on one side
or the other dropped bombs on troops from their planes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>In the great war the first nation to attempt bombing on any systematic
scale was Germany, who sent her Zeppelins over London and
Paris early in the conflict and released bombs upon the heads of the
helpless civilians. Yet this early and impressive effort was, in its
difficulties, out of all proportion to the actual damage done to the
city of London, largely due to the fact that Germany had not yet
produced effective aerial bombs. The frightful scenes and noises of
a bomb raid probably did more to reduce the morale in these early
days than the destruction caused by the exploding missiles.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly difficult trick to drop a bomb from any considerable
altitude and hit what you are aiming at. The speed of the
airplane, its height above the ground, the shape of the bomb itself,
and the currents of air acting on the falling missile influence its line
of flight. The aviator approaching an enemy target drops the bomb
long before his airplane is directly above the object aimed at.</p>

<p>The line of the bomb's flight is a parabolic curve. The speed at
which the airplane travels at first propels the bomb forward, almost
as if it had been shot from a stationary gun. As the downward
velocity of the bomb increases very rapidly, it soon becomes so great
in proportion to velocity forward that the course of the missile bends
sharply downward until, as it nears the ground, it is falling nearly
in a vertical line. Hence, it becomes evident that accurate bomb
dropping is an art attained only by much practice on the part of
the aviator.</p>

<p>The latest bombing machines were equipped with sights which
enabled the birdman to drop these deadly objects with greater
accuracy than had been possible earlier in the war. While some of
the expert European bombers scorned the new inventions in sights
and preferred to continue the use of makeshift sights which they
themselves had invented and installed on their planes, the average
accuracy of bomb dropping was considerably greater after bomb
sights came into general use.</p>

<p>These sights were adjusted to height, air speed, and strength of
wind. When these adjustments had been made, the two sighting
points were in such position that, if the bomb were dropped when
the target was in line with them, an accurate hit would be registered.</p>

<p>We adopted a British sight, tested and found satisfactory by the
Royal Flying Corps, and known as the High Altitude Wimperis,
and in the United States as the Bomb Sight Mark I-A. On November
11, 1918, American factories, working on contracts placed by the
Ordnance Department, had produced 8,500 of them. The job of
turning out this intricate mechanism was turned over to Frederick
Pearce &amp; Co., of New York City, in January, 1918. Later in the
year additional contracts were given to the Edison Phonograph
Works and to the Gorham Manufacturing Co. These contracts
called for 15,000 sights. By December 12, 1918, these concerns had
completed a total of 12,700 of them.</p>

<p>Airplane bombs are shaped so as to offer the least possible resistance
to the air. They have fins on their tails to steady them lest
they tumble over and over. On the smaller types of bombing planes,
such as the De Haviland-4, the bombs were usually carried underneath
the lower wings or under the fuselage, hanging horizontally
by hooks or fastened by bands around the bodies of the bombs,
according to their type. The bombs were dropped by a quick-release
mechanism operated by a small lever within the fuselage.
The production of these release mechanisms, of which several types
were made, was one of the troublesome jobs in connection with the
airplane bombing.</p>

<p>All bombs are carried on the planes either suspended under the
wings or fuselage of the plane or in a compartment in the fuselage.
The manner of carrying and the design of the release mechanism is
determined by the type of plane used. Since the weight-carrying
capacity of the planes is limited, release mechanisms must be designed
with a view to lightness as well as safety. These mechanisms are
so designed that the observer can release any desired number of
bombs either as a salvo or in a "trail fire," and the order of releasing
must be so arranged that the balance of the plane will be disturbed
as little as possible; that is, if bombs are carried under the wings
they should be released alternately from each wing. All bombs are
fitted with a safety mechanism which enables the observer to drop
them either "armed" or "safe," i. e., so that they will explode or
not as desired. An occasion might develop where the aviator would
have to get rid of his bombs over his own lines. These various
points are all taken care of in the design of the release mechanism
and are controlled by the observer with an operating-control handle
placed in the observer's cockpit.</p>

<p>All of the bombs used by our fliers and by the fliers of the other
nations at war were of three distinctive types&mdash;demolition bombs,
fragmentation bombs, and incendiary bombs.</p>

<p>Our Ordnance Department built demolition bombs in five different
weights: 50 pounds, 100 pounds, 250 pounds, 500 pounds, and, finally,
the enormous bomb weighing 1,000 pounds&mdash;half a ton. The most
frequently used demolition bombs, however, were those of the 100-pound
and 250-pound sizes. The demolition bombs were for use
against ammunition dumps, railways, roads, buildings, and all sorts
of heavy structures where a high-explosive charge is desired. These
bombs had a shell of light steel which was filled with trinitrotoluol&mdash;T. N. T.,
as it is more commonly known&mdash;or some other explosive of
great destructive power. The charge was set off by a detonator held
apart from the dangerous contents of the bomb by a pin. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
bomb was released by the mechanism the pin was automatically
drawn out, and the detonator slid down into position so as to explode
the bomb the instant it struck its object.</p>

<p>The first contract let for drop bombs of any type was given to the
Marlin-Rockwell Corporation of Philadelphia in June, 1917. This
contract was for the construction of 5,000 heavy drop bombs of the
design known as the Barlow, and also for 250 sets of release mechanisms
for this bomb. We were able to go ahead with the production
of this bomb at this early date since it was the only one of which we
had completed designs and working drawings when we entered the
war. In November, 1917, this order was increased to 13,000, and in
April, 1918, to 28,000.</p>

<p>The Barlow bomb, however, was destined never to cut any figure
in our fighting in France. The production was slow, due to the
necessity of constant experimentation to simplify a firing mechanism
which was regarded as too complicated by the experts of the War
Department. Finally, in June, 1918, when 9,000 of these bombs
and 250 sets of release mechanisms had been produced, a cablegram
came from the American Expeditionary Forces canceling the entire
contract.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the final type of demolition bomb, known variously as
the Mark I, II, III, IV, V, or VI, depending upon its size, had been
developed here. In December, 1917, a contract for 70,000 of the
size known as Mark II, weighing 25 pounds, was given to the Marlin-Rockwell
Corporation. But in June the American Expeditionary
Forces informed us that this bomb would not be of value to the Air
Service abroad because of its small explosive charge, and the contract
was cut down to 40,000 bombs, which number the Army could
use in training its aviators. By the end of November, 1918, bomb
bodies of the Mark II size to the number of 36,840 had been completed.</p>

<p>By the end of March, 1918, we had developed here a series of
demolition bombs that promised to meet every need of our Air Service
abroad in projectiles of their class. We let contracts for the manufacture
of 300,000 of the 50-pound Mark III size, these contracts
being reduced later to a total of 220,000. The manufacturers
were the A. O. Smith Corporation, an automobile parts concern
of Milwaukee, Wis.; the Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Co. of
Philadelphia; and Hale &amp; Kilburn of Philadelphia. Six months
later the A. O. Smith Corporation had reached a production of 1,200
of these bombs a day, and completed their contract in October.
Both the other concerns also completed their contracts in the autumn
of 1918.</p>

<p>The A. O. Smith Corporation had tooled up their factory so as to
become one of our largest producers of airplane bombs. In addition
to the contract already mentioned, during 1918 this concern
received orders for approximately 300,000 demolition bombs of the
100-pound (Mark I) size. By November 11, 1918, they had turned
out 153,000 of these and had developed a capacity for building 7,000
drop bombs daily. Another large manufacturer of drop bombs was
McCord &amp; Co., of Chicago, a concern which in 1918 received orders
for nearly 100,000 bombs of the 250-pound, 550-pound, and 1000-pound
sizes. By the day the armistice was signed this concern
had produced 39,400 completed bombs. These bombs were the
heaviest and largest ones intended for use by our service abroad.</p>

<p>The fragmentation bombs differ from the demolition bombs in
that they have thick metal walls and consequently smaller charges of
explosive. They throw showers of fragments like those of high-explosive
artillery shell. The demolition bombs contain, on the
other hand, the maximum possible amount of explosive and produce
destruction by the force of explosion. Fragmentation bombs always
have instantaneous firing mechanisms, while demolition bombs are
usually provided with delayed fuses, allowing them to penetrate the
target before explosion.</p>

<p>The fragmentation bombs produced by the Ordnance Bureau
were smaller than the demolition type, the size most commonly used
weighing 24 pounds. These bombs had thick cases and were constructed
so that they would explode a few inches above the ground.
As the bombs reach a velocity downward of over 500 feet per second,
the mechanism had to operate to an accuracy of less than one-thousandth
of a second. They were designed for use against bodies
of troops.</p>

<p>The fragmentation bombs were a late development in this class of
work. The timing device to explode the bomb at the proper distance
from the ground was undertaken by three concerns. The contracts
for approximately 600,000 of these devices were let in July,
1918. The John Thomson Press Co. of New York City completed
its contract for 100,000 mechanisms by the end of October, 1918.
The National Tool &amp; Manufacturing Co. of St. Louis completed its
contract for 100,000 shortly after the armistice was signed. The
Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Co., Stamford, Conn., which had
contracted to build approximately 400,000 of these devices, had
turned out 150,000 by the end of November, 1918. Other concerns
which manufactured various parts for the fragmentation bombs
were the American Seating Co. of Grand Rapids, Mich., makers of
school desks and seats, and the Dail Steel Products Co. of Lansing,
Mich.</p>

<p>Some idea of the quantity of fragmentation bombs in our program
may be gained from the fact that the contract for the Cordeau-Bickford
fuse used in the fragmentation bomb, let to the Ensign-Bickford
Co. of Simsbury, Conn., called for the manufacture of
550,000 linear feet of fuse, or more than 100 miles of it. The con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>tracts
for fuse were placed in August and September, 1918, and the
Ensign-Bickford Co. finished up the job on November 7, four days
before the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>The Government discovered that 3-inch shell rejected for various
reasons could be re-machined and used to make these airplane fragmentation
bombs. The various arsenals had a large supply of them
in storage. In August and September, 1918, contracts were let to
large numbers of concerns to convert over 500,000 of these shell
into fragmentation bombs, and by November 30, nearly 21,000 of
the new bombs had been delivered.</p>

<p>These bombs, made from the 3-inch shell, as far as the machining
of the bodies is concerned were turned out in various quantities
by the following firms:</p>


<ul><li>Vermont Farm Machinery Co., Bellows Falls, Vt.</li>
<li>Richmond Forgings Corporation, Richmond, Va.</li>
<li>Bethlehem Steel Co., Bethlehem, Pa.</li>
<li>Consolidated Car Heating Co., Albany, N. Y.</li>
<li>S. A. Woods Machine Co., South Boston, Mass.</li>
<li>Westfield Manufacturing Co., Westfield, Mass.</li>
<li>Wheeling Mold &amp; Foundry Co., Wheeling, W. Va.</li>
<li>A. P. Smith Manufacturing Co., East Orange, N. J.</li>
<li>Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, N. Y.</li>
<li>Keystone Machine Co., York, Pa.</li>
<li>McKiernan Terry Drill Co., Dover, N. J.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nose-firing mechanism for these bombs was produced by the
Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing Co., Stamford, Conn.; the National
Tool &amp; Manufacturing Co., St. Louis, Mo.; and the John Thomson
Press Co., New York City; while the rear cap stabilizer assemblies
were produced by the Dail Steel Products Co., Lansing, Mich., and
the American Seating Co., Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>

<p>The last item on the bomb program to come into production was
the fragmentation bomb Mark II-B, which was an exact copy of the
British Cooper bomb, the most effective bomb of this type in use by
the allied nations. Contracts for this bomb were not let until August
17, 1918, to the Lycoming Foundry &amp; Machine Co., of Williamsport,
Pa., and the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Co., of Detroit, Mich. The
former company by December 1 was producing these bombs at the
rate of 500 per day and the latter was just coming into quantity
production the first week in December.</p>

<p>When the United States entered the war no satisfactory incendiary
bombs had yet been produced by any country, and consequently a
long period had to be given over to experimentation before quantity
production could be attained. We produced two types of incendiary
bombs, the first being of the scatter type, designed for
use against light structures, grain fields, and the like, and the second
of the intensive type, for use against large structures. Later on in
our program we abandoned the manufacture of the scatter type
incendiary bombs on cable instructions from abroad, as it was found
that the wet climate made a bomb of this type of little value. The
American intensive bomb, while it had not yet come up to our ideal
and was in process of evolution during its manufacture, nevertheless
was regarded by our officers as more effective than any other bomb
of its type in existence, since it produced a larger and hotter flame.</p>

<p>Our intensive incendiary bombs weighed about 40 pounds each and
contained charges of oil emulsion, thermit, and metallic sodium, a
combination of chemicals that burns with intense heat. These bombs
were used against ammunition depots or any structures of an inflammable
nature. The sodium in the charge was designed to have a
discouraging effect upon anyone who attempted to put out the fire
of the burning charge, since metallic sodium explodes with great
violence if water is poured upon it.</p>

<p>Of the scatter bombs we built 45,000 before abandoning the manufacture,
an action taken in September, 1918. When hostilities ceased
we had out contracts for 122,886 of the intensive bombs and about
86,000 of them had been delivered ready for loading.</p>

<p>One of the large manufacturers of incendiary bombs was the
Conron-McNeal Co., of Kokomo, Ind., manufacturers of skates. The
company had to equip its plant with new machinery especially for
handling this novel manufacturing enterprise. In all, they produced
50,000 bombs and were turning them out at the rate of 400 per day
when the armistice was signed. This concern was the pioneer in the
manufacture, the subsequent contractors profiting by the experience
of the Conron-McNeal Co., and consequently being able to obtain
quantity production more quickly than the Kokomo plant had been
able to reach it. The Globe Machine &amp; Stamping Co., of Cleveland,
Ohio, built 30,000 bombs and 36,400 firing mechanisms before hostilities
closed, and eventually reached a production rate of 500 bombs
and 1,000 firing mechanisms per day. Parrish &amp; Bingham, also of
Cleveland, produced 13,000, and were turning them out at the rate of
400 daily when the production was stopped. The C. R. Wilson Body
Co., of Detroit, built 42,562 of the intensive bombs and reached a
daily production of 500. The New Home Sewing Machine Co., of
Orange, Mass., manufactured 20,000 firing mechanisms for the scatter-type
bombs.</p>

<p>One of the interesting phases of the bomb manufacturing program
grew out of the necessity for target practice for our aviators.
For this work we built dummy bombs of terra cotta, costing about a
dollar apiece. Instead of loading these bombs with explosive, we
placed in each a small charge of phosphorus and a loaded paper
shotgun shell, so that the bomb would eject a puff of smoke when
it hit its object. The aviators could see the smoke puffs and thereby
determine the accuracy of their aim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gathmann Ammunition Co. of Texas, Md., was the first contractor
for dummy bombs, building 10,000, which were delivered in
the spring of 1918. In the spring and summer of 1918, the Atlantic
Terra Cotta Co., the New Jersey Terra Cotta Co., both of Perth Amboy,
N. J., and the Federal Terra Cotta Co. of Woodbridge, N. J., each
built 25,000 of these bombs. In September additional contracts
for 50,000 dummy bombs were given to each of these three concerns,
while another contract for 25,000 went to the Northwestern Terra
Cotta Co. of Chicago. By the end of November these concerns had
delivered nearly 34,000 of the 175,000 bombs contracted for, and
were turning them out at the rate of 1,300 per day.</p>

<p>The Essex Specialty Co. manufactured 10,000 phosphorus rolls
for dummy bombs, and the Remington Arms-U. M. C. Co. supplied
10,000 shotgun shells for the first bombs produced. Later the Remington
Arms Co. produced 100,000 shotgun shells for dummy bombs.</p>


<h4>AIRPLANE PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIES.</h4>

<p>In four days of the final drive of the Yankee troops in the Argonne
district the American photographic sections of the Air Service made
and delivered 100,000 prints from negatives freshly taken from the
air above the battle lines. This circumstance is indicative of the
progress made by military intelligence from the days when a commander
secured information of the enemy's positions only by sending
out patrols, or from spies. The coming of the airplane destroyed
practically all possibility for the concealment by day of moving bodies
of men or of military works. Mere observation by the unaided eye
of the airmen, however, soon proved inadequate to utilize properly
the vantage point of the plane. The insufficient and often crude and
inaccurate drawings brought in by the airplane observer were early
succeeded by the almost daily photographing of the entire enemy
terrain by cameras, which recorded each minute feature far more
accurately than the human eye could possibly do. The airplane, to
quote the common saying, had become the eye of the Army, but
the camera was the eye of the airplane.</p>

<p>This development in military information-getting from start to
finish was entirely the product and an evolution of the great war.
When the war broke out in 1914 there were no precedents for the
military photographer to go by, nor had any specialized apparatus
ever been designed by either side for this purpose. As a result the
first crude makeshifts were rapidly succeeded by more and more
highly developed equipment.</p>

<p>At the outset of the war, before antiaircraft guns were brought to
efficiency, it was possible for the observation planes of the British,
the French, and the Germans to fly at low altitudes and take satisfactory
pictures with such photographic appliances as were then in
common use. But as the "Archies" forced the planes to go higher
in the air, special equipment had to be designed for longer distance
work under the adverse conditions of vibration and speed, such as
exist on airplanes. It is a tribute to the photographic technicians of
the world that they were able to produce at all times equipment to
meet these increasing demands.</p>

<p>As the airplanes moved into higher altitudes, longer focus lenses
had to be employed, special dry plates developed, and special color
filters provided to overcome the haze created by humidity in the
long spaces between the cameras and the ground. When the war
ended, cameras were in common use taking photographs at an altitude
of 4 miles with such microscopic fidelity as to show even where a
single soldier had recently walked across a field.</p>

<p>The American Army came into the war almost innocent of any
information at all on the subject of war photography. Such technical
information as the allied nations had developed during the war
had been most carefully guarded from us and all other neutral
countries, with the result that what information we had was of a
meager and conflicting sort.</p>

<p>Although in the early months of our participation in the war the
Signal Corps, which then had charge of all phases of aerial warfare, made
large purchases of motion-picture cameras, hand cameras, and view
cameras, it was not until the end of 1917 that our officers were able
to begin their real development of aerial photography. By this time
we had received much valuable information from the foreign high
commissions and samples of their earlier apparatus. Aerial photography
had become one of the leading activities of the air service.
Thus in April, 1917, the British service made 280,000 pictures at the
front, and a great part of all flying was done to secure photographs.
Moreover, the art was advancing at such a pace that practices in
approved use one week at the front appeared likely to become
obsolete the next, as new methods and new equipment superseded
the old.</p>

<p>For years America had been second to none as a photographic
country, and it was to be expected that this country would make
notable contributions to the new science. It may indeed be wondered
why, with the experimental laboratories and the skilled technicians
at our command, we did not start at once to develop our own aerial
designs and equipment. Our officers, however, felt that such a course
would be likely to duplicate much of the work already done by the
allied countries, who stood ready then to furnish to us the results of
their experiences. While original research work might result in the
invention here of certain equipment of superlative merit, yet we
would be sure, in the course of such an undertaking, to adopt methods
which had been tried and discarded by the allies and which we ourselves
would have to discard when experience had proven them to
be without value.</p>

<p>The information in our hands in December, 1917, showed that the
British system of air photography differed radically from that of the
French. The French cameras made a relatively large negative, 18
by 24 centimeters in dimension, on a glass plate. The magazines of
the French cameras held 12 plates, and extra magazines were carried
in the plane. These cameras were fitted with lenses of relatively
long focus&mdash;20 inches. Three operations were necessary to
make an exposure. The photographer must change the plate, set
the focal plane shutter, and press the release. When the negatives
were developed, fixed, washed, and dried, prints were made by
contact.</p>

<p>The British used a smaller-sized plate, 4 by 5 inches in size. Their
cameras were equipped with the only lenses available in England in
the early part of the war&mdash;lenses of relatively short focus, ranging
from 8 to 12 inches in this respect. Instead of making contact
prints from these plates, the British made enlargements, measuring
6&frac12; by 8&frac12; inches. In the earlier period of our development of aerial
photographic apparatus, we were in the same position as the British
as regards lenses. We had no adequate supply of long-focus lenses.
Consequently we followed the British designs of cameras and adopted
the British system almost explicitly in the training of aerial photographers.</p>

<p>It had been our first thought to use films to a great extent on the
front, since America was the country which had perfected the photographic
film, and was therefore, presumably, best equipped in skill
to adapt it to war uses. But plates had been used practically exclusively
by the British, the French, and the Italians; and it appeared
wisest to follow their experience at first, though all agreed that film,
with its small bulk and weight, would be greatly superior for airplane
use.</p>

<p>The Photographic Experimental Department of the Air Service,
which was organized in January, 1918, had as its major problems
the design and test of aerial cameras and all their parts and accessories.
Equally important with this problem was that of sensitive
plates, papers, color filters, and photographic chemicals. The corps
of photographic and optical experts, into whose hands these matters
were placed, early secured the active cooperation of the chief manufacturers
of photographic apparatus and materials in this country.
In the laboratories in Washington, D. C, Langley Field, Va., and
Rochester, N. Y., comprehensive development work was inaugurated,
leading ultimately to perfection of new designs of cameras and the
development of plates and other photographic materials equal or
superior to any available abroad.</p>

<p>The first airplane camera which it was decided to put into production
in America was a close copy of the British type "L," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
use had proven to be one of the best mechanisms employed at the
front. The operation of this camera was semiautomatic, the operator
having nothing to do except to press the shutter-release to keep the
camera at work. The operating power was derived from a small
windmill or air propeller driven by the rush of air past the plane.
The automatic mechanism changed the plate and set the shutter after
each exposure. Because of the situation with respect to lenses these
cameras were constructed to use lenses of 8-inch to 12-inch focus,
and the English 4 by 5 plate. Some 750 of these cameras were constructed.
They played an indispensable part in the training of
nearly 3,000 aerial photographers in this country. They were also
used by our bombing squadrons at the front.</p>

<p>At the same time it was generally agreed that we should plan to
follow the French practice as soon as lenses of greater focal length
could be manufactured in this country. Increase in focal length was
becoming imperative, because aerial photographers were being compelled
to make exposures from much greater heights than in the
earlier part of the war. For the sake of those unacquainted with
photography it may be stated here that lenses of short focal lengths
will not record the details of objects a great distance away from the
camera, the longer-focus, rarer, and more expensive lenses being
required for distance work.</p>

<p>As a basis for the design of cameras of longer focus a sample of
the 20-inch focus camera used by the French had been sent to this
country by the American Expeditionary Forces. The first camera
authorized of this focal length was similar in general character to this
French camera. It was constructed on the unit system, each part&mdash;shutter,
camera body, lens cone, and magazine&mdash;being of standardized
dimensions. It was understood that these standard dimensions were
to be followed in all subsequent cameras both in this country and in
the countries of the allies.</p>

<p>The idea constantly put before all designers of aerial cameras has
been that of the automatic type, in the use of which the observer or
pilot will have a minimum of work. Late in 1917 the Photographic
Section of the Air Service, American Expeditionary Forces, secured
the rights for the manufacture of an ingenious design of automatic
plate camera invented by Lieut. DeRam, of the French Army, and requested
that this be put in production. In this camera the magazine,
which carries 50 plates, 18 by 24 centimeters in size, rotates between
each exposure, while the exposed plate is removed from the front of
the pile and carried to the back. After some study here of the
incomplete model, this camera was redesigned in such form as to fit
it for methods of American manufacture. It was made semiautomatic
in operation; that is, the work of the observer or pilot consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
merely in releasing the shutter at will, a fresh plate always being in
place. At the time of the armistice 200 of these cameras were
rapidly approaching completion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile experiments were actively pushed in the matter of the
utilization of film. Various difficulties and problems had to be solved
before film could be considered practical. Considerable time was
consumed in overcoming the peculiar static electrical discharges which
occur on film in cold, dry regions, such as in high mountains or the
upper atmosphere, and fog the sensitive surface by their light. The
film camera finally decided upon was based on a fundamental design
by the Folmer &amp; Schwing organization of the Eastman Kodak Co.</p>

<p>This camera, known as the "K" type, carries a film on which 100
exposures, 18 by 24 centimeters in dimension, can be made at one
loading. The film is held flat by an ingenious device. The film strip
passes over a flat perforated sheet behind which a partial vacuum is
set up by a suction, or "Venturi," tube extending outside the body
of the airplane. The camera is entirely automatic, and is driven
either by a wind turbine of adjustable aperture or, in war planes, by
electric current from the heating and lighting circuit. The observer
in the airplane needs only to start the camera and regulate its speed
according to the speed with which the airplane is passing over the
ground below, and the camera thereafter will, of itself, take pictures
at such intervals as to map completely the terrain under observation.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the use of film in cameras came the question
of handling the film in the dark-room; that is, the ordinary manipulations
of developing, fixing, washing, and drying&mdash;a serious problem
when the large dimensions of the film, its length, and difficult characteristics
in handling are taken into consideration. This problem was
attacked and a film developing, handling, and drying machine was
produced.</p>

<p>Some 200 of these automatic film cameras were on order at the
close of the war. Altogether over 1,100 airplane cameras of all types
had been and were about to be delivered when the armistice came.
These were built by the Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester; the Burke
&amp; James Co., Chicago; the G. E. M. Engineering Co., of Philadelphia;
and Arthur Brock, jr., of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>One of the most serious problems in aerial photography is the
proper mounting of the camera in the plane. Not only does the
plane travel at great speed, which makes necessary exceedingly short
exposures and therefore highly sensitive photographic materials, but
the motor causes a continuous vibration which, communicated to the
camera itself, would be fatal to obtaining sharp pictures.</p>

<p>The experimenters of the Air Service carried out a long, extensive,
and most interesting investigation at Langley Field to make clear
the whole question of preventing the vibration of the airplane camera.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
The scientists worked out a method of making the camera itself
record the vibrations communicated to it by the plane when the
box was not held by a proper vibration-neutralizing suspension.</p>

<p>The plan adopted was to send up a camera thus mounted on an
airplane, focus it on a light on the ground below, open the shutter,
and take a time exposure from the swiftly-flying plane. The result,
of course, was a streak, or trail, written on the plate by the point
of light below, the jagged or wavy character of this trail indicating
the vibrations of the camera and determining the proper principles
of a suitable mounting.</p>

<p>The first thought was to do this work at night, as the British had
done, when the light below would pierce the darkness distinctly.
But night flying is hazardous, and a better plan was called for. Nor
would the proposal to use an extremely strong light in broad daylight
do, because, while the light would indeed be photographed continuously
across the plate, so also would the surrounding ground, and the
general result would be a fogging or blurring of the outlines of the
streak.</p>

<p>Finally the problem was solved by conducting the aerial experimental
work over woodland in the late afternoon. A strong, reddish
light was placed in the woods so as to be visible from above. The
surrounding green foliage supplied a frame of sufficient contrast to
the light to make its impression distinct on the plate. To emphasize
the contrast, the camera lens was covered with a reddish colored ray
filter, and this brought out sharply the outline of the streak.</p>

<p>These tests resulted in the design and production of new and
unique camera mountings which successfully stopped all vibrations
of the camera.</p>

<p>A problem on which it was necessary to have the closest cooperation
of the plane designers was that of installing the large 20-inch
focus cameras in the airplane. There is little room at best in a plane,
and the demands for armament, wireless, and bombing space all
had to receive attention. In the American service a distinct advance
was made in the design of a special plane intended primarily for
photographic reconnaissance. Several of these planes, which were
the most completely equipped for photographic purposes of any
designed during the war, were built and would have been put into
quantity production in the late fall of 1918.</p>

<p>Parallel with this development of apparatus went studies of the
sensitive materials and methods of photography from the air.
Because of the swift motion of the plane extremely short exposures
are imperative. Consequently, the most advanced technique of
instantaneous photography had to be applied. The cooperation
of various plate manufacturers was obtained, who brought out
especially for the Government several new plates which showed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
test to be superior to any which had appeared in the war on either
side.</p>

<p>As an airplane rises higher and higher in the sky, the moisture of
the intervening atmosphere between the machine and the ground
creates a haze which makes aerial photography above a certain
height unsatisfactory and even impossible with the naked lenses as
used on the ground. The problem of finding the best means for
piercing aerial haze occupied the attention of a corps of experts
working both in the laboratory and in the field. The solution lay in
the use of special color filters of general yellow hue which obscured
the bluish light characteristic of haze. Filters of new materials
specially adapted to airplane use were made available as a result of
this study.</p>

<p>Field equipment of quite new and special design for performing
photographic operations had to be designed and built. Among the
most interesting of these developments was the photographic truck
or mobile photographic laboratory. This consisted of a specially
designed truck and trailer containing all the equipment necessary
for the rapid production of prints in the field. The truck body was
equipped with a dynamo for furnishing the electrical current required
for lights and drying fans, while each unit was provided with an
acetylene generator for emergency use, if the electrical apparatus
should break down. The mobile dark room carried on the trailer
of each unit was equipped with tanks, enlarging camera, printing
boxes, and other necessary apparatus. In all, some 75 of these
field laboratories were constructed.</p>

<p>While the development of apparatus and new materials was from
a popular standpoint in many ways the most interesting phase of
the work of the photographic scientists, nevertheless it should be
remembered that the great problem in this, as in all other fields of
American endeavor, was to produce the supplies in tremendous
quantities. In October, 1918, we shipped overseas 1,500,000 sheets
of photographic printing paper, 300,000 dry plates and 20,000 rolls
of film. We also sent 20 tons of photographic chemicals. These
were merely the principal items in the consignment. Besides paper,
plates and chemicals, the field force required developing tents, trays,
printing machines, stereoscopes, and travelling dark rooms, to name
only some of the principal items. Much of the material already
on the market was not suitable for the purpose, a fact requiring
the production of specially manufactured supplies.</p>


<h4>THE FIREWORKS OF FLYING.</h4>

<p>It is interesting to consider that without fireworks, and particularly
some of the familiar forms of them used to celebrate the Fourth
of July, war flying would have lost much of its efficiency. Night flying
would have been well-nigh impossible, while day flying would
have had to invent substitutes for fireworks had the latter not been
available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>The squadron fields near the front were kept as dark as possible at
night for obvious reasons. The first inkling that a squadron commander
might have of the approach of one of his aviators at night
would be the sudden appearance high in the air of a green or red or
white Roman-candle ball. This would be the signal inquiring if the
landing field were clear. A pyrotechnic star of a predetermined
color, shot from the ground, would answer the homing birdman; and,
if the signal were in the affirmative, he would descend through the
sheer blackness, unable to see clearly, yet confident that he would
make his landing safely.</p>

<p>As the plane neared the ground suddenly under one of the wings
a flare of dazzling power would commence to burn, for a few seconds
flooding the field with light. In that brief space of time the plane
would have made its landing, and soon field and quarters would again
be obscured under the protecting blanket of darkness.</p>

<p>Every service airplane at the front was equipped with one or more
signaling pistols. In appearance these weapons were more murderous
than the "gat" carried by a desperado of the movies, but, like
the prize bulldog with the undershot jaw, they were more deadly in
looks than in deeds. Their formidable-appearing cartridges were
larger than the shells used in shotguns, resembling the latter almost
identically in appearance; but every one of these shells contained
only a Roman-candle ball and a sufficient charge of powder to eject
the star a good distance into the air. The sound of the discharge was
a mere whisper of the shattering roar that might be expected from
such a redoubtable piece of ordnance. These aviation pistols were
similar to the Very signal pistols used in the trenches.</p>

<p>The stars shot were three colors, red, green and white, and the
color of a cartridge's star was painted on the end of the shell. This
base was also ridged with a different pattern for each color, so that
the aviator at night could feel with his fingers and tell the color of
the cartridge without seeing it.</p>

<p>Codes of numerous messages were worked out in different combinations
of these three colors. The stars were quite visible in broad
daylight, too, and were used for many signaling purposes. They
indicated the position of enemy troops or the presence of hostile
aircraft, they called for help from other airplanes, and they signaled
squadron orders when the machines were flying in formation.</p>

<p>But the signal pistol had a more sinister use. If the pilot were
driven down in enemy territory, it became his duty to destroy his
machine. In some cases the signal pistol was used effectively to
set airplanes on fire under such conditions. The pilot had only to
open his gasoline tank and fire a Roman candle ball into the escaping
fluid. In other cases when the aviator landed amid enemy troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
he was able to hold them at bay with his signal pistol until his plane
was burned beyond the possibility of salvage.</p>

<p>While we manufactured Very pistols in this country, all of those
actually used by our fliers in France were purchased abroad.</p>

<p>Night-flying is one of the most hazardous duties of the aviator, the
chief danger being in landing. The fields well back of the front were
usually brightly illuminated by flood lights at night, but those nearer
the enemy were left in darkness, as a rule, to protect them from the
attacks of hostile aircraft. The aviator at night can usually see the
ground faintly, but he is unable to make an accurate judgment of the
distance of his machine above the ground. This danger was greatly
alleviated when the wing-tip flares were invented. The wing-tip flare
consisted of a small cylinder of magnesium material in a metallic
holder, one flare being fitted under each lower wing of the plane.
Each flare was controlled by a push button in the pilot's cockpit.
Pressure on the button sent an electric spark into the magnesium and
touched it off.</p>

<p>When the descending pilot at night judged that he was near the
ground he pushed one of the buttons. Immediately the flare ignited
and burned for about 50 seconds with the brilliant light of 20,000
candle power. Being hidden by the wing, this light did not dazzle
the eyes of the aviator, but the reflection from the under surface of the
wing lighted up the field for an adequate distance in all directions.</p>

<p>Another important use of pyrotechnics occurred in those enterprises
known as night-bombing raids. Since both sides kept their vulnerable
ammunition dumps and their important buildings completely
unlighted at night, even though the night raider knew he was in the
general vicinity of his objective, hits from bombs dropped from aloft
were almost accidental. To enable the night bomber to see his target
the interesting piece of pyrotechnics known as the airplane flare was
invented. This was a great charge of magnesium light held in a
cylindrical sheet-iron case nearly four feet long and half a foot in
diameter, the exact dimensions being 46 inches by 5 inches. The
flare weighed 32 pounds. Within the cylinder was not only the
magnesium stick but also a silk parachute 20 feet in diameter. The
entire cartridge was attached to the airplane by a release mechanism
similar to those holding the drop-bombs.</p>

<p>When over his objective at night the pilot or observer touched a
button and the entire cartridge, iron case and all, dropped from the
plane. A pin wheel on the lower end of the case was instantly spun
by the rush of air, and the resulting power not only ignited the magnesium
but at the same time detonated a charge of black powder
sufficient in force to eject from the case the flare and its tightly rolled
parachute. The parachute immediately opened; and the burning flare
descended slowly, flooding a large area of the ground below with a
light of 320,000 candlepower, this light burning for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a light not only enabled the bomber to drop his destructive
missiles accurately, but it was found by experience that it dazzled the
eyes of antiaircraft gunners below and made their aim inaccurate.
The light of this flare was so strong that it was possible for the airplane
above to obtain photographs of good detail on the darkest of nights.</p>

<p>We were just starting to produce these flares when the war ended.
In fact the actual production of pyrotechnic supplies in this country
was small, the American Expeditionary Forces depending almost
exclusively for these supplies upon French and British sources.</p>


<h4>KEEPING OUR FLIERS WARM.</h4>

<p>When the commander of an airplane squadron sends an aviator
into the high altitudes, he sends him into climate that much of the
year is colder and more severe than any known on earth, even at the
North Pole. Not only is the temperature of the air likely to be many
degrees below zero at the heights which war planes attained, but the
flier must face this bitter cold in the gale of wind that is never blowing
less than 100 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Consequently when we trained a corps of aviators to fly at altitudes
of 18,000 to 20,000 feet above the western front, it was necessary
for us to design and manufacture for them the warmest clothing
ever made. They were dressed more warmly than any Polar exploration
party that ever set forth, more warmly in fact than any other
class of men in the world. For we not only gave them the protection
of all the fine wool, leather, and fur that they could wear without
hindering their movements, but in addition we literally wrapped
them in flexible electric heaters.</p>

<p>The first purchases of aviators' flying clothes were made by the
coordinated action of the Council of National Defense and the
Quartermaster's Department. It was soon apparent that the design
of such clothing was a special matter which the aviation authorities
themselves should control, and purchases thereafter were all made
by the Bureau of Aircraft Production. There were no standard
styles at the time, so it became necessary for us to develop our own
equipment. This development resulted in an output for the flier
that became standard.</p>

<p>In moderate weather the flier wore upon his head a woolen hood,
or helmet, extending well down over the forehead to the eyes, and
around the neck to the shoulders. In cold weather, or for high-flight
work, this headgear was augmented by a silk helmet of double
thickness, having between its layers an electrically heated pad connected
by copper wire to the electric generator on the plane's engine.
Outside of this was worn a soft leather helmet lined with fur, extending
down over the back of the head, covering the ears and cheeks,
and fastening under the chin. Then the face was entirely covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
with a leather face mask lined with wool and having an opening for
the eyes, over which were worn a pair of goggles. When the pilot
was also required to operate the radio system, in place of the fur-lined
helmet he wore the radio helmet. This was of leather and resembled
the other in appearance, but it contained the receiver of the wireless
telephone, enabling the flier to hear what was spoken to him in an
ordinary tone of voice several miles away.</p>

<p>In addition to this equipment the aviator who went up to the great
heights wore the oxygen mask. This was of rubber, and, besides
supplying oxygen, it contained a transmitter, allowing him to speak
as well as to hear by wireless.</p>

<p>Over the body was worn a one-piece flying suit extending from the
feet to the throat, belted and buttoned tight at the ankles and wrists.
The outer material of this suit was waterproof, and when it was
buttoned on there were no gaps through which the air might penetrate.
This suit was lined throughout with fur.</p>

<p>It was a considerable problem to find a fur of extreme warmth
with a pelt strong enough to withstand rough usage and still not be
too great in bulk, and purchasable at a price not too extravagant.
After the furs of many beasts had been examined and tested, it was
determined that the hide and fur of a Chinese Nuchwang dog met
these requirements better than any other. We were making so
many of these suits that we required all of the dogskins we could
get, not only in this country, but in China. Merely the final purchase
of these pelts before the armistice was signed was for nearly
500,000 of them, and that many dogs in an interior Chinese province
gave up their lives that the American aviation warfare might
succeed.</p>

<p>With its waterproof outer surface and its furry lining, it might seem
that such a garment would be warm enough for any work. But the
aircraft authorities of the United States were not content until they
had installed between the fur and the outer covering thin, flexible,
electric-heat units connected by silk-covered wire with the dynamo
on the engine. Similar heating pads were placed in the gloves and
moccasins of the fliers.</p>

<p>On their hands, besides the electrically heated gloves, the fliers
wore gauntlets of muskrat fur, these extending well up the arms and
being of special design which allowed the fingers of each glove to remain
in a fur-lined pocket or to be withdrawn from the pocket without
removing the gloves from the hand. Over the electrically heated
moccasins were worn leather moccasins extending well up the calf of
the leg and lined with heavy sheep wool. These were fastened with
straps and buckles. Thus clad, our aviators were acknowledged generally
to be the most warmly and efficiently equipped of any at the
front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these special garments for warmth, the fliers required many
other items of clothing, such as sweaters, leather coats, fur-lined coats,
helmets, and many styles of goggles.</p>

<p>The total cost of air clothing, provided or in course of manufacture
on November 11, 1918, was over $5,000,000. Some of the
major items in round numbers were 50,000 fur-lined flying suits
(at $36.25), 100,000 leather helmets, an equal number of leather
coats, costing anywhere from $10 to $30 each, and over 80,000
goggles at $3.50 apiece.</p>


<h4>PROTECTION IN HIGH ALTITUDE FLYING.</h4>

<p>Even to-day the veteran of the air squadron scoffs at the newfangled
outfits of oxygen masks and tanks carried in an experimental
way on some of the high-flying planes at the western front
when hostilities ceased. Nevertheless, had the war continued a few
months longer, it is probably true that the oxygen apparatus would
have been included in the indispensable equipment of every airplane
in the front areas. Such a development, had it occurred, would
have been due largely to the efforts of the American Aircraft Service.</p>

<p>Many aviators who have gone into high altitudes, fought there,
and lived to tell about it, doubt the necessity of oxygen-supplying
apparatus, since they themselves returned safely without it. Nevertheless
the experiments conducted by the Bureau of Aircraft Production
demonstrated conclusively that the flyer artificially supplied
with oxygen in the high altitudes is much more efficient than one
who is without it. These experiments were conducted in a room
which duplicated the conditions at high altitudes. At 19,000
feet the pressure of the atmosphere is one-half the atmospheric
pressure at sea level. The lack of pressure in itself causes no
appreciable physical or mental reaction; but the reduced pressure
at 19,000 feet means that in a given amount of air there is only one-half
the oxygen that there is in a similar amount at sea level. The
lack of oxygen is serious.</p>

<p>Experienced aviators were placed in an air-tight chamber
under the observation of Government scientists. The air in this
chamber was then exhausted until it corresponded to the atmosphere
at the 19,000 feet level. The subjects were then set at small
mechanical tests, such as the pushing of certain buttons when different
colored lights were turned on, these tasks requiring a degree
of mental concentration. In this and similar tests it was discovered
that not only do the subjects lose accuracy in the attenuated air,
but their movements become conspicuously slower. In the parlance
of the pilot they become "dopey." More than one returning aviator
has confessed to this feeling when at a high altitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>When the British analyzed their air casualties during the first
year of the war they found that 2 of each 100 fliers in the casualty
list were killed or hurt by the enemy, 8 of them owed their misfortune
to defects in the planes, while the other 90 came to the hospital
or the grave because of themselves, their carelessness or recklessness,
their physical failings, and all other things which may be summed
up in the human equation. A thorough study on the part of the
British disclosed the fact that practically all of the flying personnel
was suffering from what became known as oxygen fatigue, caused by
flying so many hours each day in altitudes where there was not
enough oxygen to feed the body properly.</p>

<p>Before the war broke out the aviation record was 26,246 feet
above sea level. In January, 1919, this record had been lifted
nearly a mile, the high point being an altitude of 30,500 feet. Early
in the war pilots at the 7,000 feet level could laugh at antiaircraft
fire, and few machines ever went above 10,000 feet. Thus with the
first equipment the "ceiling"&mdash;that is, the average high level to which
every day flying goes&mdash;was about 12,000 feet.</p>

<p>When the war closed, a pilot was not safe under the 15,000 feet
level, due to the development of antiaircraft guns, and the safest
machine had become that which could fly highest. The aviators
were demanding a working ceiling of 18,000 feet, and were obtaining
it, too, from the latest type of planes. It was evident that
the reduced oxygen at this ceiling was responsible for casualties
among the fliers, and we could expect the ceiling to be pushed even
higher as antiaircraft guns became more powerful. The need of
oxygen equipment was plainly indicated. Even at 18,000 feet the
aviator relying upon the normal oxygen supply at that altitude, while
he may feel perfectly fit, is actually slow to judge distances, to aim
his guns, to fire them, and to maneuver his plane.</p>

<p>The first oxygen apparatus was designed for the British Air Service
and was made at the plant of de Lestang in Paris. The demand for
the apparatus was so great that an automobile was constantly kept
waiting at the factory that as soon as each set was finished it could
be rushed straight to the front. The first British squadron which
used oxygen equipment reported that its men gave six times the
service of any other British squadron.</p>

<p>Our Air Service adopted the Dreyer oxygen apparatus, which was
the original device produced by the British. We found it to be a
hand-made appliance, but under our direction we adapted it to American
methods of manufacture. The British apparatus was built to
supply oxygen to one man only. We changed it to take care of two
men. The model received was too heavy; we reduced the weight.
Finally we added improvements to make it more efficient and reliable
and redesigned it to meet American factory methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Such an equipment has to be entirely automatic in its operation
and as reliable as human ingenuity can make it. The Dreyer device
embodies several instruments all of which must work perfectly under
widely varying conditions. In use its tanks will contain oxygen
under pressure ranging from 100 pounds to 2,250 pounds per square
inch, yet the mechanism must deliver the oxygen to the aviator
at a constant rate regardless of its tank pressure. Then the whole
apparatus is subjected to temperatures that may be as high as 80&deg;
above zero or as low as 30&deg; below. It must function evenly in the
atmospheric pressure at any altitude up to 30,000 feet, delivering
more oxygen as the atmosphere thins. Such was the problem of
manufacture. Yet, taking up the work in January, 1918, we turned
out six complete equipments by May 3, 1918, sending them overseas
by special messenger for actual test on the front. Twenty-eight
days later we shipped 200 sets. By the end of the war we had built
5,000 complete oxygen equipments. Of this number 3,600 had been
sent to ports of embarkation awaiting shipment, and over 2,300 of
these had been shipped overseas. In October we had reached a
production rate of 1,000 sets per month.</p>

<p>Some of the difficulties of this production may be read in the
description of the complicated character of the apparatus. The
equipment consists of a small tank or tanks, the pressure apparatus,
the tube leading from the reservoir, and finally the face mask covering
the mouth and nose. The mask has combined with it either the
interphone, a mechanism which cuts off the roar of the engine from
the ears of the passengers and allows the pilot and observer to talk
freely with each other, or in certain cases the receiver of the radio
telephone or telegraph.</p>

<p>The flow-regulating apparatus consists of five parts. In front of
the pilot is a high-pressure gauge to indicate the supply of oxygen
in the tank. In the tank there is a high-pressure valve with an
upper chamber which compensates for the temperature. There is
also a shut-off valve, hand operated, which can be set to provide a
flow of oxygen to one man, to two men, or to none at all. Then there
is a regulating valve operated by an aneroid barometer which adjusts
the oxygen flow to the altitude, the flow increasing as the machine
goes higher. Finally in the pilot's view there is a flow indicator
consisting of a small fan wheel which tells the aviator that the oxygen
is actually flowing.</p>

<p>The mask presented a difficult problem, as it must be big enough
to contain the radio receivers and still enable the aviator to see and
work. Yet the mask must keep its adjustment in a gale of wind
at least 100 miles per hour in velocity.</p>

<p>The actual use of the equipment on the front was just starting
when the armistice was signed. We sent across to France a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
division of experts to take charge of the installation of these equipments
on the planes. At the close of hostilities we required all
military planes flying above an altitude of 10,000 feet to be equipped
with oxygen apparatus. This class included day bombing, pursuit,
and chass&eacute; planes, and a certain number of night bombing planes, and
Army and corps observation planes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

THE AIRPLANE RADIO TELEPHONE.</h3>


<p>Electrical science was called upon to furnish marvels and prodigies
indeed during the recent war as aids to the American arms, but in no
respect did it respond in more successful and spectacular fashion than
it did when asked to produce a wireless telephone system that would
make possible the transmission of human speech to and from moving
airplanes. It is doubtful if any other branch of science enlisted for
war work produced any instrument or mechanism so far in advance
of what was known before the war as the airplane wireless phone
was in its class.</p>

<p>To be sure, we had the radio telephone some time before America
entered the war or even before the war broke out in Europe in 1914.
Ever since the scientists began experimenting with wireless electricity
it has been axiomatic that, at least theoretically, whatever you can
do with wires you can do without wires. And so following the
development of the wireless telegraph came the production of the
wireless telephone, and the invention had been so perfected in 1915
and 1916 that in the United States Navy's official test at the Arlington
Station, across the Potomac River from Washington, human speech
sent out by the transmitters there was heard simultaneously at the
Eiffel Tower in Paris and at the Government's own wireless station
in Hawaii.</p>

<p>But there is a vast difference between using the wireless telephone
in the quiet of the radio rooms aboard ship or in the shore stations
and using it amid the roar of the powerful engine propelling an
airplane. The equipment, too, that had been used on the ground
was altogether too cumbersome to go into the fuselage of an airplane.</p>

<p>As early as August, 1910, American genius had successfully accomplished
wireless telegraph transmission from airplane to ground, and
in October of the same year the idea of aerial fleet command by
telephone was conceived and plans for its development discussed by
Army officers on duty at the International Aviation Tournament at
Belmont Park, Long Island. In 1911 a message was successfully
transmitted from an Army airplane over a distance of 2 miles. In
1912 the Signal Corps had increased the distance to 50 miles. Two
years later, in the Philippine Islands, a message had been successfully
received on an airplane in flight over a distance of 6 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1915 the Aviation Section entered upon a definite plan of
development of aircraft wireless at the Signal Corps Aviation School,
San Diego, Calif. This plan was based upon the Belmont Park
idea and discussions, with the voice-commanded tactical air fleet as
the ultimate goal. The airplane had changed from the pusher to
the tractor type, with the noise of the motor of the latter driven
back by the blast of the propeller into the face of the aviator. The
airplane wireless problem was thus quite completely changed. Under
these new conditions, however, the development was entered upon,
and it has since been continuous. In October a spring-driven dictaphone
was taken into the air and a record of speech made in the
noise of the motor. This was contemporaneous with the successful
long-range experiments in radio telephony at Arlington, referred to
above. A study of this dictaphone record convinced the aviation
officers that the idea of the radio telephone for airplanes was entirely
practicable. Experiments during the fall and winter with various
means of driving the wireless power plant resulted in a decision
to develop the air fan as a source of power rather than the gear or
belt system.</p>

<p>This development continuing through 1916, transmission by telegraph
from airplane was accomplished up to 140 miles, means for
receiving in the noise of the motor were worked out, and a message
successfully telegraphed between airplanes in flight. The radio
telephone was under construction, and in February, 1917, the voice
was first transmitted by telephone from airplane to ground. Like
Alexander Graham Bell's first wire telephone, the apparatus was
crude. But the door was unlocked and ready to be opened upon the
new field of development.</p>

<p>When on May 22, 1917, Gen. Squier, the Chief Signal Officer of the
Army, called upon the scientists to develop at once an airplane telephone,
he was not only introducing them into what was to many of
them a new field, but he was asking them to produce what the science
of Europe had been unable to create in nearly three full years of
acquaintance with the successful ground system, although the needs
of airplane fighting demanded this invention as they demanded
almost nothing else.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that when we began this development as a
war measure we had a considerable basis of experience to work
upon. The Army had established the foundation of operation on
the airplane, made a study of the tactical requirements, and knew
what it wanted. The Western Electric Co. in 1914 and 1915 had
conducted extensive experiments with the radio wireless telephone
at a ground station at Montauk, Long Island, and had played an
important part in the long-range experiments at the Arlington
station. There had been wireless voice communication before this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
time, but the apparatus and systems perfected at Montauk set the
standard on which all subsequent development was built. The
French Scientific Mission and other officers of the allies had arrived
and enabled us to check up what had been done abroad and to confirm
or modify our ideas of the tactical requirements.</p>

<p>At the conference with Gen. Squier in May was Col. Rees of the
Royal Air Force of Great Britain; Col. C. C. Culver, United States
Army, then a captain; and F. B. Jewett and E. B. Craft, respectively
the chief engineer and the assistant chief engineer of the Western
Electric Co.</p>

<p>At this meeting Gen. Squier outlined the future of the part the airplane
was to play in the war, and pointed out how invaluable would
be a successful means of communication between battle planes when
flying in squadron formation. Mr. Jewett had received his commission
as a major in the Signal Corps, and he was ordered to take charge
of the work of developing radio communication for aircraft.</p>

<p>Capt. Culver had taken part in the 1910 experiments and discussions,
and since 1915 had been conducting the Army development of
airplane wireless at the aviation school at San Diego, Calif. He
was detailed to work with Maj. Jewett and his engineers, bringing
to their assistance the result of his experience and the point of view
of the trained military man and the aviator.</p>

<p>The first development was carried on in the laboratories of the
Western Electric Co. on West Street, in New York. Men and materials
were drafted from every department of the company, and the
laboratories were soon seething with activity. In a few weeks the
first makeshift apparatus was assembled, and the first practical test
of a radio phone on an airplane was made at Langley Field at Hampton,
Va., less than six weeks after the Signal Corps had given the
go-ahead. Three employees of the Western Electric Co. on that day
established telephone communication between an airplane in flight
and the ground. A few days later the first apparatus produced successful
communication between planes in the air.</p>

<p>It is not possible here to go into a technical description of the
wireless telephone. The most vital part of the apparatus, however,
and the essential factor in airplane wireless telephone communication
is a vacuum tube containing an incandescent filament, a wire mesh
or grid, and a metal plate. By means of electrical current the wire
filament is heated to incandescence. The tube has the property of
receiving the energy of the direct current of a dynamo and, through
the medium of the wireless antenn&aelig;, of throwing it out into space as
a high-frequency alternating current. Such is the sending tube. A
modification of the same tube picks up from the antenn&aelig; the high-frequency
alternating vibrations from another sending apparatus and
transforms them into direct current, carrying the sound waves of the
human voice along with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>The design of the radio apparatus itself was relatively simple for
the experts who had undertaken the work, for the company had
already developed some highly successful forms of vacuum tubes, and
it was an easy matter for these technicians to assemble tubes with the
necessary coils, condensers, and other apparatus of the transmitting
and receiving elements and produce a system of such small compass
that it could be carried on an airplane. But working this apparatus
under ordinary conditions in the quiet laboratories and in a swift-moving
and tremendously noisy airplane were two different propositions.</p>

<p>One of the first problems was to design a comfortable head set which
would exclude all undesirable noises and admit only the telephone talk.
A form of helmet was finally devised with telephone receivers inserted
to fit the ears of the pilot or observer. Cushions and pads adjusted
the receiver to the ears, and the helmet fitted close to the face so as
to prevent as far as possible the transmission of undesirable sounds
either through the ear passages or through the bony structure of the
head, these bones acting as a sort of sounding board. The designers
finally developed a helmet that solved this portion of the problem.</p>

<p>Not only was it necessary to exclude the roar of the engine and the
rattle of the machine gun from the ears of the men receiving the radio
communication, but it was also necessary to filter out these sounds
from the telephone transmitter. Every person who has ever shouted
into a telephone knows how sensitive the ordinary telephone transmitter
is to extraneous noises. It requires no wide stretch of the
imagination to hear in fancy how an ordinary transmitter would
behave when beside the exhaust of a 400-horsepower Liberty engine.
A brilliant line of experimentation conducted by one of the scientists
at the laboratory resulted in a telephone transmitter or microphone
which possessed the extraordinary quality of being insensitive to
engine and wind noises and at the same time highly responsive to the
tones of the human voice.</p>

<p>With the receiver and the transmitter perfected the scientists
thought that the problem of airplane telephoning was solved; but
nevertheless three months of hard work were required before the
entire system could be adjusted and put in such shape that it might
be considered a practical device for everyday use.</p>

<p>The question of weight was of utmost importance, and a structure
that would adequately house and protect the delicate parts of the
mechanism from the vibration and jars of flying and landing and at
the same time not be too heavy for practical use on the plane was a
difficult problem in mechanical design. Day after day the inventors
took the mechanism up in flying machines and brought it back
night after night for more work in the laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a period, however, of rapid progress. Officials appearing
on Langley Field from time to time witnessed informal demonstrations
of this development. In August Mr. Baker, Secretary of War,
and Gen. Scott, Chief of Staff, listened to a conversation being carried
on in the air, and some six weeks later Brig. Gen. Foulois witnessed a
similar demonstration and from the ground directed the movements
of the airplane in flight. The experimental apparatus had reached
such a state of efficiency that on October 16, at Langley Field, communication
by voice was carried on between airplanes in flight 25
miles apart and from airplane to ground over a distance of 45 miles.
By September cables had been sent abroad telling of the progress
made in this country on the development of this apparatus. Our
officers abroad were skeptical and could not believe that this country
could outdistance the scientists of the allies who had had three years
of war experience to draw upon. By October the designers had
brought the system to a perfection where they were willing to risk
its use in actual war flying, and Col. Culver took to the American
Expeditionary Forces in France several trunk-loads of the apparatus
to acquaint those abroad with what had been done and to test the
apparatus under service conditions. Meanwhile the development
work continued in this country. Early in December the operation
of the apparatus was exhibited in an official test at the Morraine
Flying Field at Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<p>A large number of military and civilian officials not only of our
own country but of the allies had been invited to witness this test.
It must be remembered that at this time even those who had heard
about the progress being made were skeptical of the possibilities of
the successful adaptation of the radio telephone to airplane work.
The designers of aircraft never look with favor upon additional
equipment which may clutter up the machine with trailing wires
and the like and possibly compel alterations in standard lines. The
pilots, also, do not usually give a friendly reception to new equipment
for their planes.</p>

<p>The exhibitors at Dayton planned to have two planes in the air at
once, so that the officials might listen in on their conversation at a
ground station located on the top of a hill near the flying field. By
hard work the inventors got their equipment installed, and just at
dark on the evening before the day of the trial one machine equipped
with wireless went up into the air and held successful communication
with the ground.</p>

<p>The next morning when the official party arrived the members
viewed the apparatus in the planes while the inventors explained
what it was expected to do. The visitors were then conducted to the
station on the hill, where those who were putting on the show had
rigged up a megaphone attached to the wireless receiver so that everyone
could hear without putting on a head set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>The attitude of some of the officials, particularly those from the
foreign nations who had had experience in war flying, was skeptical,
if not bored. The planes left the ground, and when the machines
had gone up so high that they were but specks in the sky the receiver
began emitting the premonitory noises that indicated that the men
in the planes were getting ready to perform. Suddenly out of the
horn of the loud-speaking receiver came the words: "Hello, ground
station! This is plane No. 1 speaking. Do you get me all right?"</p>

<p>Looks of amazement came over the faces of all those who had
never heard the wireless phone in operation before. Soon came
the signal from plane No. 2, and then the demonstration was on.
Under command from the ground the planes were maneuvered over
much of that part of the country. They were sent on scouting expeditions
and reported what they saw as they traveled through the
air. Continuous conversation was carried on, and finally, upon command,
the planes came back out of space and landed as directed.</p>

<p>From that moment there was nothing but enthusiasm in all quarters
for the radiophone upon airplanes. It was no longer a question
whether the device would work or was any good, but a question of
how soon the company could start manufacture and in what quantities
the device could be produced.</p>

<p>The demonstrations Col. Culver had been conducting in France
began, too, to bear fruit. Both the British and the French had
developed experimental apparatus by this time and this was examined
and tested. Then cablegrams began to arrive from abroad requisitioning
the American apparatus in large quantities&mdash;convincing
evidence that it had greater promise than any other.</p>

<p>But still difficulties were ahead, for at this stage the wireless telephone
consisted of a few experimental parts built by hand. It remained
a heavy task to standardize the equipment and perfect the multitude
of designs and drawings that must be in existence before quantity
manufacture could begin. All sorts of mechanical details slighted in
the experimenting and taken care of by makeshift devices had to be
worked out as practical manufacturing undertakings. It was
another case of day-and-night work to put the mechanism into condition
for production. The factory of the Western Electric Co. is in
Chicago but its drafting rooms and laboratories are in New York. As
soon as any detail was finally worked out the drawings were taken by
messengers and rushed to Chicago where the work of producing the
manufacturing tools had begun. Only the fastest passenger trains
between New York and Chicago were patronized in this part of the
development.</p>

<p>As every detail was perfected it had to be checked by actual test in
the field, so that the company's engineers were almost constantly in
the air. One of these experts made 302 flights himself; and a total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of 690 flights, of a combined duration of 484 hours, was required in
the experimental stage of the mechanism.</p>

<p>Immediately after the official trial in December the Government
ordered thousands of sets of the radio telephone. In spite of the
enormous detail involved in making ready for production, the first
systems were turned out early in 1918, well ahead of the delivery of
the airplanes in which they were to be used.</p>

<p>All through this development the designers had to confine their
activities within limits set by the producers of the aircraft. This in
itself created some puzzling problems. For instance, a constant
current of electricity must be supplied to heat the filaments of the
vacuum tubes and to operate the transmitter. A simple way to
provide this current would seem to be to connect a dynamo with the
driving shaft of the airplane engine, but the airplane constructors
would not allow any such connection with the engine. Current
could be supplied from storage batteries, but the planes were already
loaded down with all the gear they could carry, and the use of heavy
batteries was out of the question. Therefore it was the task of the
phone designers to supply a dynamo plant that would not add appreciably
to the weight of the plane. This was done by installing on the
outside of the plane a wind propeller, which was driven by the rushing
air and had power enough to turn the dynamo.</p>

<p>The dynamo must deliver a constant and unvarying voltage to
the radio phone, if its operation is to be possible, yet a wind propeller
on the airplane would be driven by air rushing by at speeds varying
from 90 or 100 to 160 miles per hour, the latter figure being the speed
of a diving plane. This meant that the wind propeller, and hence
the armature of the dynamo, would revolve at a speed varying from
4,000 to 14,000 revolutions per minute. It would seem to be impossible
to procure current at a constant rate from a dynamo varying
so widely in its speed of operation; yet one of the experts engaged
in this enterprise solved the problem, and the dynamo thereafter performed
always in a most steady going and dependable manner.</p>

<p>Incidentally as a sort of by-product of the undertaking the special
transmitter and helmet may be employed as a means of communication
between the pilot and observer in a two-seated machine. When
the helmet is used for this purpose, the wireless is not employed at
all, but the head sets are connected by wires so that notwithstanding
the fact that one can not hear himself talk because of the noise
on the plane the pilot and observer can converse over the telephone
with ease. Then at any time by throwing a switch they can connect
themselves with the radio apparatus and talk with the men in
another plane 3 or 4 miles away or to their squadron headquarters
on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>One good result of the airplane telephone was to speed up the
training of aviators in this country and to make that training safer.
But the primary object of the wireless phone was to make it possible
for the leader of an air squadron at the front to control the movements
of his men in the air. For this purpose extra-long range was
not required, and the distance over which the machines could talk
was purposely limited to 2 or 3 miles so that the enemy could not
overhear the conversation except when the planes were actually
engaged in fighting each other.</p>

<p>The Navy made use of the wireless telephone sets in the seaplanes,
and here the range of the equipment was made greater. The Navy
also adopted a modified form of the set for the 110-foot submarine
chasers. The subchasers hunted the submarines in packs, and by
means of the radio telephone the commanders of the boats kept in
constant touch with each other, thereby greatly increasing the effectiveness
of their operations.</p>

<p>Altogether there were produced for the Army airplanes about 3,000
combined transmitting and receiving sets of the radio telephone and
about 6,500 receiving sets alone.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

BALLOONS.</h3>


<p>When Stephen Montgolfier and his brother Joseph, in November,
1782, sent a sheep, a rooster, and a duck into the sky, lifted by a
paper bag inflated with hot air, these Columbuses of ballooning could
scarcely foresee the importance that their invention was to have
in the great war 135 years later. To the humble observation
balloon in France rather than to his dashing hero of a cousin, the
airplane, must go the chief credit for that marvelous accuracy which
long-range artillery attained during the great struggle.</p>

<p>The balloon itself was spectacular enough once its true character
was known. The fact that the American production of observation
balloons during our 19 months as a belligerent was a complete
and unqualified success makes the story of ballooning in France of
particular interest to the American reader.</p>

<p>After the animals of the Montgolfier barnyard had made their
ascent, two friends of the brothers, M. Pilatre de Rozier and Girond
de Villette, essayed to be the first human beings to take an aerial
flight, ascending to a height of 300 feet and returning to earth sound
of limb and body. Thereafter and until the great war in Europe
the balloon remained the awe of the circus and country fair grounds
and the delight of the handful of sportsmen who took up the adventurous
pursuit; but, except for a limited use of captive balloons in
our Civil War and in the siege of Paris, in 1870 and 1871, the balloon
had no important military use.</p>

<p>The hot-air balloon never could have become of great value to
armies. In the first place, it would descend when the balloon
cooled off. This defect was overcome by the use of lighter-than-air
gas. Moreover, the free balloon was subject to the whims of the
breezes. To overcome this characteristic the balloon must be
fastened by a cable or propelled by a portable engine. It was
obvious, however, to military experts that a stationary observation
post anchored thousands of feet in the air would be ideal in war
operations; yet for all of this obvious need, until the great war military
science had perfected nothing better than the spherical balloon.
The spherical, anchored to a cable, bobbed aloft in the gales and
zephyrs as a cork does on the ocean waves. Although there had been
some experimentation with kite balloons before 1914, it was not
until the great war had been in progress for some months that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
principles of streamline shape were applied to the captive balloon;
and the kite balloon, the well-known "sausage," made its appearance,
to be the target for enemy aerial operations and the chief dependence
of its own Artillery.</p>

<p>The term "kite balloon" effectively describes the captive observation
balloon as we knew it in the war. It rides the air on the end
of its cable much in the manner of an ordinary kite, and some of the
early "sausages" even flaunted steadying tails such as kites carry.
These principles applied to the captive balloon gave to its observation
basket a stability unknown by the pioneer aeronauts under their
spherical bags.</p>

<p>In the first stages of the war the Artillery relied principally upon
airplanes for firing directions. But, while the airplane observers
could locate the targets fairly well, they frequently lost touch with
their batteries because of the difficulty of sending and receiving
wireless or visual signals upon their swiftly moving craft. This disadvantage
brought the captive balloon into use, gradually at first,
but before the end of the war on a scale which had practically displaced
the airplane as a director of gun fire. The balloon came to
be the very eye of the Artillery, which, thanks to the development
of this apparatus, reciprocated with an efficiency beyond anything
known before in the history of warfare.</p>

<p>Sitting comfortably aloft, the observer in the kite balloon basket
had the whole panorama of his particular station spread before him.
His powerful glasses could note accurately everything transpiring in
a radius of 10 miles or more. He was constantly in touch with his
batteries by telephone and not only could give by coordinated maps
the exact location of the target and the effect of the bursting shell,
but could and often did supply most valuable information of enemy
troop movements, airplane attacks, and the like. He was a sentinel
of the sky with the keen, long-range vision of the hawk. He played
a part less spectacular than the scout airplane with its free and
dazzling flights, but his duties were not less important.</p>

<p>Nor did he suffer from ennui during his period aloft. When a kite
balloon went up it became the subject of alert attention by the
enemy, because it was up there on hostile and damaging business.
Long-range high-velocity guns turned their muzzles on it, and planes
swooped down upon it from dizzy heights, seeking to pass through
the barrier of shell from antiaircraft guns and get an incendiary
bullet through the fabric of the gas bag, an eventuality which meant
the ignition of the highly inflammable hydrogen gas, the quick
destruction of the balloon and perhaps of the luckless occupants of
the basket as well, unless they could get away in their parachutes.</p>

<p>Only quick work could save the men in the basket in such a case.
From the time the gas leaped into flame until the explosion and fall
of the balloon there was an interval of rarely over 15 or 20 seconds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
The pilot of the airplane could dodge and slip away from the guns,
but not so the pilot of the kite balloon anchored to a windlass from
2 to 5 miles behind his own lines. He had to take what was coming
to him without means of defense. He must carry on his scientific
calculations unconcernedly and in his spare moments experience the
questionable pleasure of watching on some distant hill the flash of
an enemy gun trained upon him and then of waiting the 20 or 30
seconds for the whizzing messenger to reach him, the while he pondered
on the accuracy of the enemy gunner's aim.</p>

<p>While the artillery on both sides paid considerable attention
to the observation balloons, the fact was that few of them were
brought down by direct shell hits. The diving airplane with its
incendiary bullets was a far more deadly enemy to the balloon than
the ground artillery. Certain pilots in all the air services made a
specialty of hunting sausages, the nickname given to kite balloons
because of their shape. In the 17 days between September 26 and
November 11, 1918, our Army lost 21 balloons, of which 15 were
destroyed by enemy planes and 6 by enemy shell. But it may be
noted that our aviators and artillery exacted a toll of 50 German
balloons in the same period and on the same front. Of 100 balloons
lost at the front, an average of 65 were destroyed by enemy attacks
and 35 by natural wear and tear.</p>

<p>The German general staff so strongly appreciated the work of the
allied kite balloons that in its system of rating aviators it ranked a
balloon brought down as the equal of one and one-half planes.</p>

<p>The average life of a kite balloon on an active sector of the western
front was estimated to be about 15 days. Some of them lived only a
few minutes. One American balloon passed unscathed through the
whole period of American activity on a busy sector. While ordinarily
five or six months of nonwar service will deteriorate the balloon
fabric, there are many cases of useful service longer than this.</p>

<p>When the war broke out Germany is said to have had about
100 balloons of the kite type. France and England had few of
them. The German balloon was known as the Drachen. Its gas
cylinder of rubberized cotton cloth was approximately 65 feet long
and 27 feet in diameter, the ends being rounded. To give it a kite-like
stability in the air a lobe, which was a tube of rubberized fabric,
of a diameter approximately one-third of the diameter of the main
balloon, was attached to the underbody of the gas bag as a sort of
rudder, which curved up around the end of the balloon. This lobe
was not filled with gas, but the forward end of it was open so that
when the balloon rose the breeze filled the lobe with air. The
inflated rudder then held the Drachen in line. The lobe automatically
met the emergency. In calm, windless weather the balloon needed
no steadying and the lobe was limp. Let the gale blow, and the lobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
inflated and held the nose of the Drachen into the wind. As a
further stabilizer three tailcups, with mouths open to the breeze,
were attached 10 feet apart on a line descending from the rear of the
balloon. In a strong wind these helped to keep the contrivance from
swinging.</p>

<p>The tail-cup was made of rubberized fabric, circular in shape, about
4 feet in diameter, and about 2 feet deep when inflated by the breeze.
It looked like an inverted umbrella, and was attached to the tail end
of the balloon for exactly the same purpose and with the same effect
as the tail attached to a kite.</p>

<p>The Drachen type of balloon was still in the experimental stage
here and in France and England when the Germans swept over
Belgium. The Drachen balloon was clumsy and relatively unstable
in high winds, yet its importance to the Artillery could not be
ignored by the allies. The results of its work daily became more
apparent. The first effort of the allies was to improve the Drachen
to give it greater stability and permit it to go to higher altitudes.
While this work was going on, Capt. Caquot, of the French Army,
produced a kite balloon so superior that it quickly superseded what
had been in use. Germany clung to the Drachen for a time, but
finally abandoned it for the Caquot principles of design.</p>

<p>The earlier balloons of the sausage type had been merely cylinders
with hemispherical ends. Now for the first time, in the Caquot
model, appeared a captive that was sharply stream lined. Stream
lines are lines so curved as to offer the least possible resistance to the
medium through which a mobile object, such as a yacht, an automobile,
or an airship, moves. The Caquot gas bag was 93 feet long, as compared
with the Drachen's 65 feet of length, yet its largest diameter
was only 28 feet, being but a foot thicker than the pioneer German
type. The Caquot, as all balloons developed in the war, was made
of rubberized cotton cloth. Its capacity of 37,500 cubic feet of
hydrogen gas lifted the mooring cable, the basket, two observers,
and the mass of necessary equipment, and in good weather the
balloon could ascend to a maximum altitude of over 5,000 feet.</p>

<p>The principal innovation in the design of the Caquot balloon was
the location of the balloonette or air chamber within the main body
of the gas envelope. This chamber was in the forward instead of
the rear part of the bag and along the bottom of the envelope. It
was separated from the gas chamber by a diaphragm of rubberized
cotton cloth, which was sewn, cemented, and taped to the inner
envelope somewhat below the "equator" or median line from the
nose to the tail of the gas bag.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>When a balloon of the Caquot type is fully inflated, the diaphragm
rests upon the underbody of the gas envelope, and there is no air in
the balloonette. Then, as the balloon begins to ascend, at the
higher levels the surrounding air pressure is reduced and the gas in
the balloon expands. This expansion would normally burst the
envelope when the balloon is at a high altitude, except for a safety
valve which pops at the danger point and relieves the pressure.
Also, when the balloon is anchored it gradually loses gas, since no
fabric can be made entirely gas-tight. A flabby balloon in a gale of
wind is dangerous to the men in the basket. This flabbiness might
be expected to increase, too, as the balloon was hauled down into
the heavier air pressures.</p>

<p>It was to overcome this flabbiness that the interior balloonette
was first invented, but the new location not only accomplished this
end but increased the stability, lessened the tension on the cable and
allowed an almost horizontal position of the balloon itself. As the
balloon rises the wind blows into the balloonette through a simple
scoop placed under the nose of the balloon. This forces up the diaphragm
and compensates for any loss of gas from the envelope above.
If the day is calm and no air is driven into the balloonette, there is
no danger from a flabby balloon anyhow, and hence no need for the
air chamber. The thing is automatic.</p>

<p>The Caquot was equipped with lobes of rubberized fabric to act
as rudders. These lobes, which were spaced equidistantly around
the circumference of the rear third of the balloon, filled with wind
when wind was blowing and there was need of rudders. In calm
weather the lobes, particularly the two upper ones, hung loosely,
resembling elephant ears. On account of this characteristic the
Caquots were nicknamed "elephants" by the soldiers.</p>

<p>The Caquot maintained its stability without tailcups, and its
construction caused it to ride nearly horizontally and directly above
its mooring, regardless of winds. In this position it put much less
strain on the anchoring cable than the old-fashioned sausage. This
balloon has been operated successfully in winds as high as 70 miles
an hour, so that apparently no gale could keep it on the ground.</p>

<p>When we went into the war both our Army and Navy were
practically without observation balloons, and we knew little about
their construction, although we had been watching the developments
in Europe. One local National Guard organization had
taken to the Mexican border a locally designed captive balloon,
the gift of the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., of Akron, Ohio.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, the total production capacity of the United States
was for only two or three military observation balloons in a month.
But when the emergency came the various concerns whose plants
were adaptable to this class of manufacture&mdash;the list including the
Goodyear and Goodrich organizations at Akron, the United States
Rubber Co., the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., the Connecticut
Aircraft Co., and the Knabenshue Manufacturing Co.&mdash;all joined
wholeheartedly with the Signal Corps to solve our balloon problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these problems was the production of balloon cloth, for
which there had never been any commercial call in this country.
Such cloth obviously must be of cotton, for in cotton we had our
largest supply of textile raw material. The cloth must be closely
woven, smooth, and strong, to serve as a base for the rubberizing
process. The standard balloon cloth should have a weave of approximately
140 threads to the inch both ways. In our vast cotton
industry only a few mills had ever made such a cloth, and then only
in small quantities. In fact we found only a few looms in existence
capable of weaving such cloth, which must be from 38 to 45 inches
wide. A single loom could turn out only an average of ten yards
of this cloth in a day. Our balloon program was to call for millions
of yards of high-count cloth, and this meant the construction
of thousands of new looms, as well as the training of hundreds of
weavers.</p>

<p>Naturally our cotton manufacturers were reluctant to undertake
such a production, and their fears were justified when we found that
the earliest deliveries of balloon cloth were frequently as high as 67
per cent imperfect. By the middle of 1918, however, the mills had
so perfected their methods that the wastage amounted to only 10
per cent of the cloth woven. This wastage was largely caused by
"slubs," knots, and other imperfections which prevented an even
surface for rubberizing. Because of the lives which depended upon
having perfect balloon cloth, the fabric was literally inspected inch by
inch, and hundreds of men and women had to be educated especially
in this inspection work.</p>

<p>The development of the new art of weaving balloon cloth was an
achievement of no mean degree. In April, 1917, all of our cotton
mills put together could produce only enough cloth to build two
balloons a week. In November, 1918, our looms were turning out
cloth sufficient for 10 balloons a day, an expansion in the industry
amounting to 3,000 per cent in 19 months. This expansion proceeded
at a rate that always kept us a little ahead of the military
schedule. To produce 10 balloons a day the cotton mills had to
turn out 600,000 yards of special cloth a month. In addition to
the small army of weavers, this production called into service 3,200
looms.</p>

<p>Had the war continued another year, we would have reached our
goal of 15 complete new kite balloons produced every day. Our
complete project of balloons and dirigibles of all types called for a
total output of 20,000,000 yards of balloon cloth. Had we reached the
quantity production planned, we would have been able to supply
not only our own needs but also all of the balloon needs of the allies
in Europe. America had the raw materials necessary for the whole
anti-German balloon program.</p>

<p>As it was, we supplied to France and England a considerable
number of balloons when the materials shortage in those countries
was becoming acute. The foreign users of this American made
equipment reported that it was equal to the best European product.
It should have been. No war material was ever manufactured more
conscientiously than this. In addition to the painstaking care of
the producers, from start to finish a large force of inspectors watched
every step in the construction of each balloon, and when America
sent a balloon to the front it was right for the work it had to perform.</p>

<p>The weaving of the cloth was but the first step in the production
of the balloon fabric. The fabric of the balloon envelope resembles
a sandwich in its construction, there being a thin film of specially
compounded rubber between two plies of the cotton cloth. The
outer ply of the cloth is cut on the bias. This method prevents any
long straight tear down the grain of the fabric. The threads of the
inner ply are set at an angle of 45&deg; to those of the outer ply, thus
distributing strain sufficiently to stop a "snag" practically where
it starts.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth alone can not resist the seepage of gas, and, therefore,
it is necessary to rubberize it, the rubber film being really the
gas-resisting envelope. In this rubberizing process the cloth must be
run through the spreading machine 30 to 35 times in order to build
up the thin rubber film without a flaw in it of any kind. The outside
ply of the balloon fabric is "spread," that is, painted with a rubber
compound containing a coloring matter. This compound makes the
fabric waterproof; it gives also protective coloring to the balloon
when in the air, making it less visible to the enemy; and, finally and
most important, this coloring absorbs the actinic rays of the sun
which are so fatal to the life of rubber. In some of the fabric the rubber
film itself was colored to withstand both the heat and ultra-violet
rays, thus both protecting the rubber and reflecting the heat which
would otherwise expand the gas in the balloon.</p>

<p>While in general we adopted the European standards of construction,
we had to develop our own rubber compounds and cures as well
as our various fabrication processes. The latest reports we received
from the front stated that the American fabric not only was successful,
but that it had an added characteristic which was a direct means of
saving life. It was discovered that the American fabric burned
more slowly than the European balloon fabric, giving the men in
the observation basket more time to get away in the parachutes
when the balloons were destroyed by hostile attack.</p>

<p>When we went into the war we had never built a windlass for a kite
balloon. The ability of the American manufacturer solved this
problem as it did almost every other problem in the development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
war instruments. Steam was the motive power first used for windlasses,
but before the fighting came to an end America had developed
both gas and electric windlasses which were thoroughly efficient.</p>

<p>The best known type of gasoline windlass was that having two
motors, one to turn the cable drum controlling the balloon's ascent
and descent, and one for moving the windlass itself along the road.
A record pull-down speed of 1,600 feet a minute, or more than
three times the speed of the fastest passenger elevator, has been
attained by the gasoline windlass.</p>

<p>The electric windlass, while pulling down the balloon at the slower
rate of 1,200 feet per minute, was smoother in operation. The
mobile windlass would move on a road under its own power at 20
miles an hour and could tow the balloon in the air at the rate of
5 miles an hour, or even faster if necessity demanded.</p>

<p>To play on the safe side at the start, we adopted a satisfactory
windlass that had been developed in France. It was difficult to
manufacture this entirely French machine with American materials
and methods; yet James Cunningham, Sons &amp; Co., of Rochester,
N. Y., succeeded in obtaining a delivery of four complete windlasses
per week.</p>

<p>In addition to this windlass we designed two of our own. One of
these was the product of the United States Army Balloon School
and was manufactured by the McKeen Motor Car Co., of Omaha,
Nebr.; the other windlass was designed and manufactured by the
N. C. L. Engineering Co., of Providence, R. I. Both were put into
quantity production, assuring us a sufficient number of the best
windlasses ever manufactured.</p>

<p>The first cable used to hold the balloon captive was approximately
a quarter-inch in diameter, weighed 1 pound for each 8 feet of length
had a breaking strength of 6,900 pounds, and was made of seven
twisted strands of plow-steel wire, containing in all 133 separate
wires. This cable, while it accomplished the original purpose, was
early seen to have fine possibilities of development. The observers
in the basket must be kept in constant communication
with the Artillery and their own windlass and this communication
could best and most efficiently be obtained by means of the telephone.
The balloon telephone, as first used, was an entirely individual unit
with its own separate cable from the basket to the ground. In this
way communication was indeed established, but only at the cost of
a decrease in possible altitude, increased cable resistance, and the
necessity of an extra windlass for winding and unwinding the telephone
cable.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Previous to the entrance of the United States in the war, preliminary
experiments in France were being made with the view of
putting the telephone wires in the center of the main cable, thus
doing away entirely with the second cable and windlass. But there
had never been developed a satisfactory cable of this construction.
American inventiveness at the John A. Roebling Sons Co. and the
American Steel &amp; Wire Co. was set to work on this problem with the
result that not only was a satisfactory cable developed but a steady
production was attained, 50,000 feet per week being delivered regularly
by the John A. Roebling Sons Co. alone. This new cable consisted
of 114 separate wires of special steel besides the telephone center
of 3 copper wires properly insulated and armored. The specifications
demanded a breaking strength of 7,200 pounds while the actual test
of the finished Roebling cable showed 8,250 pounds.</p>

<p>Another of the balloon problems was the supply of hydrogen gas.
Before the war only a little hydrogen was used in this country, the
element being a by-product in the manufacture of commercial
oxygen. We met the additional demand for millions of cubic feet
of hydrogen for our balloons by establishing Government gas plants
and expanding privately owned plants already in existence. There
were two methods of supplying hydrogen to our balloon units at
home and abroad. One of these was by furnishing portable plants
which would generate hydrogen at the place where it was to be used.
The other was to take the hydrogen from the stationary plants,
condense it by pressure in steel cylinders, and ship it to points of
demand. By far the greater part of the gas which we used not only
in this country but in France was produced at the permanent supply
stations and shipped in cylinders. Each cylinder held about 191
cubic feet of gas under a pressure of 2,000 pounds per square inch at
68&deg; F. temperature. When the war ended we had placed orders for
172,800 of these cylinders, of which 89,225 had been delivered and
were in use. We developed a manifold filler which would take the
gas from 12 to 24 cylinders at the same time and quickly inflate a
kite balloon, a speed of 23 minutes for a complete inflation having
been reported from one training camp.</p>

<p>In the production of portable hydrogen generators we had to
produce not only the machine but the chemicals required in the process.
We adopted the ferrosilicon and caustic soda process by which
it was possible to produce 10,000 cubic feet of hydrogen per hour in a
field generator. There was plenty of caustic soda to be had, but
high grade ferrosilicon, a production of large electrolytic furnaces,
was scarce, because of its heavy consumption in the steel industry.
We procured, however, 2,482 tons of it for our generators, of which
over 2,360 tons were supplied by the Electro-Metallurgical Sales Corporation
alone.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the gas supply in the field was the use of
"nurse balloons." The nurse balloon was simply a large rubberized-fabric
bag with a capacity of 5,000 cubic feet of gas. It was used for
storage of gas, and the observation balloons were fed from it. We
have not received the exact figures of the quantity of gas used by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the entire Balloon Service; but, as one item alone, private manufacturers
previous to the signing of the armistice produced and delivered
17,634,353 cubic feet of hydrogen and were in position to meet practically
any demand for the gas. This figure is only a small part
of the total, since it does not include the hydrogen produced in the
permanent Government stations or by the field generators.</p>

<p>Hydrogen itself, while the lightest of cheap gases, and therefore
the one universally used in balloons, has the grave fault of being
dangerous to the balloonist. When mixed with the air it is highly
explosive, if touched off by a spark of fire or electricity. For years
balloonists have dreamed of a gas light enough to have great lifting
power, but which would not burn nor explode. There was such a
gas known to chemistry, and this was helium, discovered first in
spectroscope examinations of the corona of the sun, but later found
by chemists to exist rather freely in the atmospheric envelope of the
earth. Although one of every 100 parts of air is pure helium, it was
not until comparatively recent years that this light nonexplosive gas
was discovered in our atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now helium was rare and expensive, and until the United States
entered the war no one had considered its production as a commercial
possibility. Up to two years ago the total world production of helium
since its discovery had not been more than 100 cubic feet in all, and
the gas cost about $1,700 per cubic foot.</p>

<p>It had been discovered that certain natural gases issuing from the
ground in the United States contained limited quantities of helium.
The question was whether we could extract this helium in sufficient
quantities to make its use practical. The Signal Corps, the Navy,
and the Bureau of Mines combined in a cooperative plan to develop
a practical helium production. By adopting a method of obtaining
the helium from liquefied gas produced in the processes of the Linde
Air Products Co. and the Air Reduction Co., and also by the Norton
process, we attained astonishing success in this enterprise.</p>

<p>On the day the armistice was signed we had at the docks ready
for loading on board ships 147,000 cubic feet of helium. At its prewar
value this gas would have been worth about $250,000,000. On
November 11, 1918, we were building plants which would produce
helium at the rate of 50,000 cubic feet per day, and the cost of obtaining
it had dropped from $1,700 per cubic foot to approximately 10
cents.</p>

<p>None of this gas was actually used in the war, but its production
by our chemists was hailed as the greatest step ever taken in the
development of ballooning. It now seems to have opened a new era
in lighter-than-air navigation. In war helium will nullify the incendiary
bullet which destroyed so many balloons and airships. In peace
it brings the possibilities of new types of construction of dirigible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
airships, since its use eliminates entirely all of the frightful dangers
from lightning, static electricity, or sparks and flames from gasoline
engines or any other source.</p>

<p>The Army and Navy cooperated in the production of balloons.
The Army furnished the balloon cloth to the Navy. Navy balloons
had two automatic safety valves for the expanding gas, one on each
side of the balloon a third of the way back from the nose and just
above the equator; while the Army held to the French and British
idea of a single valve in the nose itself. The Navy adopted a Caquot-type
balloon which rides at an angle of about 25&deg; to the horizontal
and is somewhat smaller than the Army model. The Navy used
these balloons as spotters for submarines and mines. They were
towed on cables from the decks of war ships, and were connected with
the ships by telephone.</p>

<p>The use of parachutes with balloons is a comparatively recent development,
the man who first successfully descended to earth in a
parachute being not only still active and enthusiastic over aerial
development, but being in fact the chief inspector of all United States
Army balloons and parachutes. This is Maj. Thomas S. Baldwin,
known the world over as Capt. "Tom" Baldwin, hero of innumerable
aerial exploits of all kinds under all conditions and in all parts of the
world, and at present chief of the United States Army balloon inspection.
The Yankee balloon observer in France went up to his observation
post in the security of knowing that the equipment on which
his life depended had been O. K.'d by men who knew the business
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>The parachute as it is known at the county fair and the parachute
used in the recent war were far apart in type, the latter embodying
all the improvements that the world's aeronautical experts could
add to it. The need for parachutes developed when hostile aviators
began shooting down the sausages. At first the one-man parachute
was used exclusively, the men in the basket leaping overboard the
instant their balloon was fired over their heads. Any delay on their
part would be fatal, since the entire bag would be consumed in
15 or 20 seconds and the observer would then be unable to leap
out of the falling basket. When the individual parachutes were
used, the maps and records in the balloon basket were usually lost.</p>

<p>To overcome these difficulties, the designers invented the basket
parachute. This was considerably larger than the individual parachute,
and to operate it the balloonists pulled a cord which cut the
basket away from the balloon entirely. The spreading parachute
overhead then floated the basket, with the men themselves and all
else it contained, safely and quickly to the ground.</p>

<p>Although hundreds and even thousands of parachute jumps
occurred during the war, there were few fatalities from this cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
During all the time our forces were at the front only one of our men
was killed as the direct result of a parachute drop. In that particular
instance the burning balloon fell on top of the open parachute,
setting it on fire and allowing the observer to fall unprotected the
rest of the distance to the ground. One of our observers was known
to make four jumps from his balloon on the same busy day, and
another leaped thrice in four hours. In the Argonne offensive 30
balloon jumps were made by our men.</p>

<p>As to the safety of our parachute equipment, the only complaint
from the Yankee balloonists at the front was that they were too safe.
The man who is escaping from a German airplane nose-diving at him
with a machine gun spitting fire is in a hurry and does not wish to
be detained by a parachute which floats him too slowly to the earth.</p>

<p>In the rigging of each kite balloon there are about 2,000 feet of
rope of different sorts. There was a shortage of proper cordage in
the United States at first, and the French thought they could furnish
this rigging to us. But this attempt proved to be unsuccessful, and
we were forced to develop a cordage manufacture in this country of
high quality and great quantity. We did this so swiftly that there
was no serious delay to the balloon production.</p>

<p>Up to November 11, 1918, we produced over 1,000 balloons of all
kinds, 642 of these being of the final Caquot type which we adopted.
This production included many propaganda balloons for carrying
printed matter over the lines into the enemy's country. We supplied
several target balloons for gun practice on our aviation fields.
We developed new types of parachutes and built acres of canvas
hangars for balloons. We produced 1,221,582 feet of steel mooring
cable. These are only the major items in the balloon enterprise, and
do not include hundreds of others of less importance.</p>

<p>The balloon production was one of the most important and successful
of all our war projects. Although we had a limited knowledge
of the subject in the beginning, our balloons stood the hard test of
actual service and could bear comparison in every way with the best
balloons of Europe, where the art of balloon building had been in
existence for many years. Once our production actually started,
we never had any shortage of balloons for our own Army; and soon we
would have been in a position to produce the observation balloons
for all of the armies fighting Germany, if called upon to do so.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

THE ENGINEERS IN FRANCE.</h3>


<p>In describing the activities of the Engineers, we are carried to the
front itself, into the zone beaten by enemy fire, where machine-gun
bullet, bursting shell, and deadly gases have brought sudden death
and painful wounds to many members of the technical services. A
large proportion of the Engineers are combatant troops, constituting
in the American Expeditionary Forces about 8 per cent of the total
combatant troops engaged. These troops, trained and equipped to
march and fight as Infantry, demonstrated their fighting qualities
during the war on numerous occasions, both when used as Infantry
to increase the rifle strength of that arm and when fighting as Engineers
to obtain possession of terrain as a preliminary to the exercise
of their technical art in its organization.</p>

<p>From the day the first sector was taken over by American troops
in November, 1917, until the Meuse River was passed and the enemy,
in flight, sought an armistice to save his armies from destruction,
the combatant Engineers&mdash;the "sappeurs" of French soldier lore
and song&mdash;- fought and bled in a manner never to be forgotten. Railroad
engineers, nominally considered noncombatant, at Cambrai
dropped their tools to take arms and stand stubbornly shoulder to
shoulder with their British brothers with whom they were learning
to work under the special conditions of the front. From
Cantigny to Chateau Thierry, Engineer troops fought as well as
worked, and often not only advanced with the Infantry under or
through the barrage, but actually led the first wave, to demolish or
remove the obstacles placed in its path. Through the days when
from March 21, 1918, until July 18, 1918, the German army made
its rapid plunges toward Paris until checked and thrown back
across the Marne at Chateau Thierry, the sapper troops fought
and worked with the Infantry of their divisions, enduring the same
dangers, privations, and hardships, and winning equal honors and
commendation.</p>

<p>In the drive at St. Mihiel and through the Argonne, the combatant
Engineers played a conspicuous part. Advancing with the tanks,
they made possible the passage of many difficult points for these
lumbering monsters, against which was directed a particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
destructive fire. Using elongated torpedoes of high explosive, known
as Bangalore torpedoes, they prepared passages for the Infantry
through the broad barbed-wire entanglements, echeloned in depth
by numerous separate lines, each to be breached and passed before
the objective could be gained. In this work the Engineers reduced
the machine-gun nests that hindered their operation, cleaned up the
strong points that delayed the advance of the tanks they were
assisting, and threw extemporized footbridges across the streams
which barred the further advance of the Infantry.</p>

<p>The combatant Engineers did their part in the winning of the
reconquered ground as well as the lion's share of its organization
for the defense and the maintenance of the communications behind
it. In this last respect alone, the Engineers, as combatant troops,
opened across No Man's Land the first communications practicable
for the light field artillery, which pressed forward immediately behind
the Infantry troops to their support and protection.</p>

<p>Filling in trenches, removing wire entanglements, building trestles
across wide mine craters, searching for and rendering inoperative
treacherous mines and traps of extreme ingenuity and destructiveness,
the sapper found a wide field for the exercise of his functions.
Shattered and obliterated by four years of shelling and mining,
trenching, and countermining, the "roads" across No Man's Land
existed only on the map; and as they retreated the Germans demolished
and obstructed the highways behind the old front from which
they had been driven, with the thoroughness and attention to detail
for which they are noted. As our Infantry advanced, upon their
heels, literally speaking, came our Engineers, to attack the problem
of providing for the Artillery and supply trains a means of following.
From the standpoint of the road builder in civil life, their methods
were crude in the extreme, but for the military purpose and the
pressing immediate needs, their road building achievement was
adequate. The Engineers sometimes reopened abandoned quarries,
and sometimes started them where none had existed before, to obtain
a supply of road metal, which supply was sometimes supplemented
and in some cases replaced by the use of debris from ruined villages
and shattered farmhouses. From demolished structures many useful
materials were extracted and adapted to the military purpose by
the Engineers. Where bridge and trestle timbers were lacking,
deserted buildings&mdash;in one case the tower of a ruined church&mdash;filled
the need. Where shell hole or crater yawned a remnant of a stable
wall might be pulled down by ropes and man power, and broken up
to fill the void.</p>

<p>Through the dense woods the soft forest floor offered no support
even to the light artillery, and miles of corduroy and brush path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
were built to permit the guns to advance to the reinforcement of the
attack. In many places the tactical situation admitted of insufficient
time to build even the crudest paths, and then the Engineers fell to
and assisted artillery and supply wagons to get through and over the
bad spots, replacing guns on the road where they had run into the
ditch, righting and reloading combat wagons when they had turned
over in shell holes or deep ruts.</p>

<p>While thus engaged the sapper troops were subjected to the fire
of enemy artillery seeking to prevent the advance of the supporting
guns, and, further, they were working within the zone of combat of
enemy aviators, the rattle of whose deadly machine guns, as they
plunged at low altitude toward a busy working party, was as much
to be dreaded as the high-explosive bombs which they dropped.</p>

<p>Behind the combatant Engineer troops, extending through the
service of supply to the base ports and across the ocean to the United
States was an organization of technical noncombatant supply and
administration.</p>

<p>The work of these production, construction, and supply departments
of the Engineer service in France was organized in the American
Expeditionary Forces under the administration of three divisions
of the office of the Chief Engineer. These were the division of military
engineering and engineering supplies, the division of construction
and forestry, and the division of light railways and roads.</p>


<h4>ENGINEERING SUPPLIES.</h4>

<p>The division of military engineering and engineering supplies was
charged with the procurement, standardization, and distribution of
all classes of supplies used by Engineer troops. During the 19 months
of warfare this division handled 3,225,121 tons of supplies, storing
them and distributing them from immense depots aggregating 25
acres of covered storage and over 756 acres of open storage. This
service was further charged with the current investigations into new
developments of the art of military engineering, and with the development,
operation, and administration of certain technical branches of
the American Expeditionary Forces, such as electrical and mechanical
troops, water-supply troops, searchlight regiments, etc.</p>

<p>At its seven storage depots in the base, intermediate, and advance
sections, this division had in service 23 locomotive cranes, mostly of
15 tons capacity and capable of handling an enormous amount of
freight and material at warehouses and cars. The following table of
principal items of engineer material shows the kinds and quantities
of supplies which were received in France for issue through this
division up to December 15, 1918:</p>

<p>To facilitate the procurement of supplies in the existing world
markets, this division established in Paris a purchasing board, having
branches in England, Switzerland, and Spain. When the war ended
this board had accomplished the tremendous task of buying over
1,800,000 tons of engineer supplies, with a total value of $205,242,728.
In addition to this material, our own country furnished over 1,500,000
tons, with a value of $248,993,322. France sold to us through this
board 1,234,968 tons, valued at $134,393,870, and England 396,000
tons, valued at $56,145,818. In Switzerland, purchases consisting
principally of sectional barracks and technical equipment, totaled
96,867 tons, with a value of $14,643,410. Purchases from Spain
amounted to only 797 tons, with a value of $59,630.</p>

<p>Much work was done in standardizing supplies of all classes, so
that quantity-production methods could be used in their fabrication,
thus promoting economy and stimulating the rapidity of supply.</p>

<p>In the procurement of cement for the use of the American Expeditionary
Forces, the Engineers dealt successfully with a problem of
large magnitude and importance. By contract with English and
French mills, by direct purchase for specific jobs from local mills,
and by their own manufacturing operations, the Engineers secured
enough cement to supply the demands for construction both at the
front and in the S. O. S., as the service of supply was generally
known. Three large cement mills were leased from the French
owners and operated by special troops organized in the United States.
To certain other French mills the Engineers furnished labor and
materials in return for a certain proportion of their output. It is
estimated that about 215,000 tons of cement were thus procured,
representing a total cost of about $7,000,000.</p>

<p>The Engineers operated shops at various points near the front in
which were manufactured standard material for dugout, trench, and
emplacement construction, such as concrete beams, concrete slabs for
overhead protection against high-angle shell fire, trench frames, revetment
material, trench duck boards, mine and gallery timbers,
knockdown bunk sets, etc.</p>


<h4>CONSTRUCTION AND FORESTRY.</h4>

<p>The division of construction and forestry was charged with all construction
work in the service of supply, and also with the procuring
of forest products for the American Expeditionary Forces. At the
signing of the armistice its organization totaled 150,823 men, of whom
about 127,000 were constantly engaged in production work. Using
standardized building plans, this force performed a huge amount of
construction work in France.</p>

<p>It was assumed that one-third of the American troops in France
would have to be housed in new buildings erected specially for the
purpose. Thus accommodations for about 750,000 men had to be
built at the rate of 16 barracks, each 20 by 100 feet in size, for every
1,000 men. Contracts were let to British and French contractors for
23,000 demountable barracks, this order being based on the ultimate
probable size of the Expeditionary Forces. During August, September,
and October, 1918, these barracks were being received at the rate
of 1,000 per month. To supplement a supply of even such magnitude,
our own type of barrack was developed to be built with lumber furnished
by the American forestry forces in France. One cantonment
project involved the construction of 500 barracks, accommodating
55,000 men. A total of 11,862 barracks were erected for the American
Expeditionary Forces in France, representing 225 miles of length, if
all the barracks were placed singly end to end.</p>

<p>It was the policy of the American Expeditionary Forces to provide
hospital room sufficient to give beds, if necessary, to 15 of every 100
American soldiers in France. On this basis the Engineers set out to
provide hospitals with a total of 280,000 beds. Of these, 139,000 beds
were in hospitals taken over from the French, 25,000 beds being
added to this capacity by new construction. In entirely new base,
camp, evacuation, and convalescent hospitals, 116,000 beds were
ultimately made available for the casualties of the American Expeditionary
Forces, requiring the erection of 7,700 hospital barracks of
special type, all of which would have totaled 127 miles in length if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
placed singly end to end. As to the progress of this construction,
on November 14, 1918, there were 190,356 beds occupied in American
hospitals in France, but all 280,000 beds originally specified were
ready and available.</p>

<p>The base hospital plants were complete municipalities in themselves,
and had capacities varying from 1,000 to 6,000 beds. These
units were built where nothing had existed before but little French
rural communities, devoid of the improvements and modern conveniences
with which we in this country are so familiar. To establish
a modern military hospital, capable of caring for the varied casualties
and illness arising from action and abnormal living conditions, it
required the construction of roads, sidings, unloading platforms,
sorting and classification buildings, operating rooms, surgical and
medical wards, dormitories, morgues, cemeteries, complete water supplies,
fire protection systems, sewage and garbage disposal plants,
recreation buildings, electric light plants, and all that goes to make
complete a modern installation for the care of the wounded and sick.
Many of the camp and evacuation hospitals required construction of
the same character, but differing in magnitude.</p>

<p>The Engineers developed port faculties at St. Nazaire, Bordeaux,
La Pallice, Marseilles, Brest, and at less important harbors. In
general, at these places the existing facilities were expanded to meet
the needs for the debarkation of troops and the unloading and shipment
of supplies. Originally 23 ship berths were placed at our disposal by
the French. The Engineers expanded this equipment to a total of 89
berths, with authorized projects for 160 berths by June, 1919. Our
overseas shipments grew from 20,000 tons in July, 1917, to 1,000,000
tons in October, 1918, but the port expansion kept abreast of this
development. Fifty-eight 300-ton lighters were built by Engineer
troops with French timber, and twenty-six 500-ton lighters with
American timber. The Engineers constructed seven derrick barges
with lifting capacities ranging from 30 to 100 tons.</p>

<p>The existing French railroads running from the base ports to the
advanced zone were quite inadequate, so that it was necessary to
supplement their facilities with many miles of new track and other
construction, including important storage, classification, arrival, and
departure yards, warehouse tracks, engine terminals, water points,
and repair shops. At Bassens, St. Sulpice, Miramas, and Montoir,
enormous storage depots were constructed to handle the supplies
entering France for our forces. The American-built railroad yards at
these points were comparable in magnitude and completeness to the
important yard developments undertaken in this country in recent
years by the large railroad systems, the yards at St. Sulpice having a
trackage totaling 147 miles of single track. Those at Bassens and
St. Sulpice were virtually completed during the war, while the construction
at Miramas was well under way at the signing of the armistice.
At St. Sulpice the project was designed on the basis of receiving,
storing, and forwarding the supplies for 1,000,000 men for 30 days.
The others were of like magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>At Nevers, in the intermediate section, a condition existed requiring
the construction of six miles of new double-track line, with a
bridge over the Loire River 2,190 feet long. This piece of construction
is known as the "Nevers Cut Off." It relieved the railroad congestion
at this important point.</p>

<p>At Is-sur-Tille, in the advance section, was built a regulating
station at which train loads of supplies and troops were dispatched
to points where needed. Still farther toward the front, at Liffol-le-Grand,
was another and smaller regulating station, controlling troop
movements and the distribution of munitions and subsistence.
Both of these projects were entirely new and were in useful operation
when the war terminated.</p>

<p>In addition to the above projects, many storage yards, hospital
tracks, ordnance depot yards, aviation center tracks, and construction
tracks were laid out and built. In all 937 miles of single track
were laid, thus fulfilling in the equivalent the prediction that to supply
an American Army at the front we should have to build a double-track
railroad from the French coast to the trenches.</p>

<p>Storage depots, remount depots, and veterinary hospitals erected
by the Engineers proved entirely adequate for the needs of the
American Expeditionary Forces at all times. A grand total of 536
acres of covered storage was built or acquired, of which about 482
acres was new construction. Space was provided in remount depots
for 29,000 animals, and it was projected to accommodate 48,700 animals
had it been necessary. Veterinary hospital space was provided
for 17,250 sick animals. Each veterinary hospital required much
special construction, such as concrete dipping tanks for the treatment
of mange, operating rooms, exercising paddocks, hay sheds, living
quarters for attendants and veterinary surgeons, and administration
buildings.</p>

<p>At Gievres, in connection with the important storage depot built
there, was constructed the third largest refrigerating plant in the
world. This plant, built by the Engineers from plans prepared by
experts, was capable of caring for 5,200 tons of meat at once, and of
producing 250 tons of ice per day. Another similar plant at Bassens
had a capacity for 4,000 tons of meat.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous construction work in France covered many fields of
activity. The question of adequate water supply was ever present,
and in most places where hospitals, depots, shops, or warehousing
plants were built, a water supply development was incidentally
necessary. Many systems were installed complete from the col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>lection
of the water at its source to its distribution to the points
of consumption, while in some other cases only extensions and
ameliorations of existing systems were undertaken. Water supply
in the service of supply was placed under as fine and complete a
system of bacteriological inspection and examination as is customary
under more normal conditions. At Tours, Vierzon, St. Nazaire, and
Dijon, where unfavorable bacteriological conditions existed, arrangements
were entered into with these municipalities whereby the
existing water supplies were chlorinated by the American water
supply service.</p>

<p>At Is-sur-Tille was built a mechanical bakery at which 500,000
pounds of bread, fresh for immediate shipment to the troops at the
front, could be produced in one day. Another such plant was built
and put into service at Neufchateau, and at Liffol-le-Grand it was
proposed, and plans had been prepared, to construct a third plant for
400,000 pounds of bread per day, but this project was canceled just
after the armistice. In addition to these plants, bakery capacity for
240,000 pounds per day was provided at the base ports.</p>

<p>Oil storage was provided for 175,000 barrels of oil and gasoline.
The large plants, with tanks having a capacity of 25,000 barrels each,
built with enduring concrete foundations and equipped with connections
and pumping plant for the loading of tank cars destined for
the front, rivaled in size the installations at large refineries of this
country.</p>

<p>For the operation of these many plants numerous power developments
were undertaken, and a total of 5,000 kilowatts of new power,
being provided for at the time of the armistice, was canceled. Plants
of the capacity of 750 kilowatts each, providing 3,500 kilowatts of
electric power in all, were in operation when the armistice was signed,
not to mention numerous smaller units installed at various points
where needed.</p>

<p>Ordnance repair shops were erected, as were also assembling plants
for ordnance material, and heavy gun-mounting plants. Repair
shops of enormous extent were established near the front, equipped
with machine-tool equipment for the repair and maintenance of
tank and motor transport material. Schools for the line and staff were
constructed, the first and largest being at Gondrecourt and Longres.
Laundry plants, salvage depots, aviation assembly plants, sewage
disposal plants, refuse incinerators, mechanical repair shops, locomotive
assembly plants and locomotive round-houses were placed
at convenient points. At Chalmdray and at Colombey-les-Belles,
both within a short day's automobile ride of the front, were the
tank and air-service repair depots, each one covering many acres
of ground and each provided with full equipment for any job of

<p>The forestry work of the American Expeditionary Forces was developed
to meet the heavy demands of our armies for forest products
of all kinds. The first move in this direction was the dispatch to
France of the Tenth Engineers, a forestry regiment of two battalions.
This was in September, 1917. By the spring of 1918 we had recruited
and trained the Twentieth Engineers, a forestry regiment of 10 battalions.
Later additional forestry troops were sent across. Shortly
before hostilities ceased all these troops were consolidated into a
single regiment of 13,000 men, known as the Twentieth Engineers.
To this force were added negro service troops to the number of 9,000,
making 22,000 men engaged exclusively in the work of cutting down
French forests and turning them into lumber required by our forces.</p>

<p>At first we had difficulty in supplying the necessary machinery.
Until the sawmills came the forestry troops were engaged in building
camps and hewing out railroad ties. In January, 1918, the machine
equipment began to arrive. In February our troops cut about
3,500,000 feet of lumber; while in October the cut for the single
month had reached the enormous figure of 50,000,000 feet. When
the war ended we were expanding our forestry operations in France
to produce 1,000,000,000 feet of lumber in a year.</p>

<p>The lumber produced by our sawmills in France up to November
30, 1918, would build completely enough barrack buildings 20 feet
wide to stretch out to a distance of 600 miles if placed end to end,
quarters enough for 3,107,600 men. In addition to this output the
railroad ties produced would build 1,091 miles of standard-gauge
railway and the small ties for the 24-inch track would build a double-track
railroad behind 185 miles of trenches.</p>

<p>Just the posts and poles produced, if all cut into 6-foot posts,
would be sufficient to support a wire fence, with posts one rod apart,
reaching one-third of the distance around the earth. The piling, if
stood end to end, would make a flagpole 362 miles high. The cord-wood
produced would make a rack 1 yard wide, 1 yard high, and 600
miles long.</p>

<p>The sawmill machinery installed to accomplish such a production
comprised 30 mills of 20,000 feet per day capacity, 56 mills of 10,000
feet per day capacity, and 92 smaller mills capable of producing ties
and rough timber.</p>

<p>In the base and intermediate sections a large amount of work
was necessary in the maintenance of the existing roads and highways,
and in the construction of new roads in the vicinity of the various
new projects. Experienced road engineers, drawn from civil life
and commissioned as officers of the Army, were put in charge of this
work, and specialist engineer troops and labor battalions were assigned
to them. Quarrying the rock, grading the road, surfacing it, and
maintaining it in good condition thereafter&mdash;all these duties fell
within the province of the engineers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>


<h4>LIGHT RAILWAYS AND ROADS.</h4>

<p>The light railway and road regiments of engineers attached to
the armies at the front, while their duties did not carry them so far
or so much into the zone of enemy fire, may be considered as combatant
units, since they operated with and in support of combatant
troops in the field. To the light railway regiments were assigned the
construction, operation, and maintenance of the light railroads of
60-centimeter gauge (about 24-inch gauge). A great quantity of
such trackage was used during the war. These narrow-gauge railroads,
capable of being operated under extreme conditions of grade
and curvature, and powered with light steam and gasoline locomotives,
were essential to the proper supply of a stabilized sector.
They were the lines of communication between the railheads of the
broad-gauge system and the dumps and depots within the front
sectors. At the very front, sometimes within a few hundred meters
of the German lines, these light railroads were operated by hand or
animal traction, while further back the gasoline locomotive, less conspicuous
than the steam engine, came well within range of the enemy's
light field pieces. In periods of activity and during an advance
these railroads did a tremendous service, not only in transporting
troops, munitions, materials, and subsistence stores, but in affording
a means of bringing up rapidly a certain class of railway artillery
adapted for use upon 60-centimeter gauge trucks. Built of light
rail and steel ties assembled in portable sections, this track was easily
destroyed by shell fire, and such was often its fate, yet it was but
short work for the engineers to replace broken sections with new
material, a work frequently done under heavy fire. Engineer troops
suffered many casualties in this service.</p>

<p>In cooperation with the Engineer Department in the United States,
a practical, efficient, and standard type of narrow-gauge motive
power and rolling stock was developed by American manufacturers.
This material was shipped to France knocked down, and was assembled
and set upon the rails at Gondrecourt, where a plant for this
purpose had been established. Up to November 30, 1918, there
had been built and placed in operation 538 miles of 60-centimeter
track, with 347 steam and gasoline locomotives furnishing motive
power for the operation of 3,281 cars of different types.</p>

<p>The road-building regiments in the zone of the armies built and
maintained the roads immediately behind the front. Equipped
with modern road-building machinery and motor trucks, these regiments
maintained the roads in shape to handle the abnormally dense
and heavy traffic incidental to operations at the front. The Army
road troops were recruited from among men accustomed in civil life
to road building, quarrying, and construction operations. They
usually worked well within sound of the enemy guns, and frequently
under their direct fire. During the advances made from the stabilized
line of June, 1918, these regiments improved and perfected the hasty
roads thrown across No Man's Land by the sapper regiments of the
fighting divisions, so that transport of supplies and troops could be
maintained to the advancing armies. To furnish materials for this
construction many quarries were opened or taken over from the
French road service. A total of 42,000 cubic meters of rock was
quarried and prepared for use in quarries operated exclusively by
American engineers, while in quarries jointly operated with French
forces 75,000 cubic meters were produced.</p>


<h4>MAP MAKING AND PRINTING.</h4>

<p>A vitally important part of the work of Engineer troops was the
making and reproduction of the many maps required for the conduct
of tactical and strategic operations by the American Expeditionary
Forces. A highly specialized regiment was organized to conduct the
topographic surveying operations, map reproduction, and printing
work in France. Many of the officers of this regiment had been
formerly connected with the American Coast and Geodetic Survey
and the Geological Survey, and they were well qualified for the work
of war-map making. At Chateau Thierry a portion of this organization
rapidly mapped to a large scale the new region in which the
theater of operations suddenly found itself, thus supplementing the
excellent small-scale map which was in existence for the whole of
France, but which was not sufficiently precise for the conduct of
our artillery fire. This work was done under pressure, but it contributed
its share to the later American successes in that locality.
These troops also were charged with furnishing to the Artillery the
mathematical azimuths and coordinates, on the basis of which artillery
indirect fire was executed.</p>

<p>The maps in use even on stabilized fronts were in a constant process
of revision and change. The data and information on which
these changes and revisions were based were constantly pouring in
from the photographic branch of the air service, from the intelligence
service, the Artillery, and from the sapper regiments at the
front. Consequently new maps had to be prepared continually
and furnished to all the organizations and officers concerned with
their use. Then, too, an Army as large as ours required an impressive
amount of field printing in order to distribute its orders and
information.</p>

<p>As soon as our forces reached France it was apparent that the
French map-production plant could not take care of our needs.
The Chief of Engineers in the United States thereupon ordered the
purchase of equipment for a base printing plant large enough to
take care of all the map printing for an army of 1,000,000 men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
The special machinery ordered in the United States for this plant
did not arrive in France during 1917, and so the American Expeditionary
Forces purchased abroad five large rotary lithographic presses,
several type presses, and a number of linotype machines and other
printing equipment.</p>

<p>The base printing plant was established at Langres, France. In
the spring of 1918 the American equipment arrived, and thereafter
the base printing plant was able to print not only the current maps
required but also the base maps which the French had been supplying.
In addition, during the heavy fighting in July and August,
1918, our printing plant supplied to the Seventh and Eighth French
Armies the base maps of their fronts.</p>

<p>The demands for maps and printing steadily increased until the
base printing plant grew to have a working force of 35 officers and
750 men. From July 15 until September 15, 1918, the plant worked
continuously 24 hours a day to turn out the work required. By
this time the shop had 10 rotary lithographic presses, 4 linotype
machines, and several job presses, printing each month an average
of over 1,200,000 lithographic impressions and 500,000 sheets of
printed matter. In November the plant turned out 1,900,000 lithographic
impressions and over 1,000,000 sheets of type work.</p>

<p>To supplement the base printing plant we had at each army
headquarters an advanced printing shop to supply maps when they
were needed within a few hours. At the base printing plant we
had a department for making relief maps, which work had been
done for us previously by the French Government.</p>

<p>The equipment for military map making was enriched during this
period by an invention of Maj. James N. Bagley, United States
Engineers, called the aerial cartograph, or map camera. The
Bagley camera's three lenses at the height of 5,000 feet could photograph
a strip of territory 3&frac12; miles wide.</p>


<h4>MILITARY BRIDGES.</h4>

<p>The science of building military bridges is an old one. When
war with Germany was declared the United States had developed
its heavy ponton equipment, which was standard in design and yet
which had changed but little since the Civil War. As soon as we
formally took the step to send troops against Germany the Engineers
ordered great quantities of this equipment and by the latter part
of 1917 had plenty of it ready to go overseas. Our deliveries to
France, however, were hindered by the shortage in ocean tonnage,
particularly after we had begun to use every available ship for the
transport of men.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the efforts of the Engineers were being directed to the
development of standard ponton equipment strong enough to carry
tanks and the ponderous artillery of the present day. The old ponton
bridge was first strengthened to carry loads of 5 tons on each of
two axles spaced 10 feet or more apart. The standard prewar
equipment would support only 3 tons similarly spaced.</p>

<p>The next step was to develop a bridge that would hold up axle
loads of 10 tons with a distance of 12 feet or more between axles,
although in actual use this bridge showed itself capable of supporting
a load of 15 tons concentrated on one axle. As soon as these developments
were made, the plans were mailed to the American Expeditionary
Forces, so that the Engineer Corps abroad could provide
the beams and metal parts at its own mills and shops in France.
When the fighting ceased, the Engineers were designing a raft capable
of transporting the heaviest portable ordnance then under manufacture
in the United States.</p>

<p>In 1917 the Engineer Department made designs for a standard
sectional steel bridge, consisting of short latticed steel truss sections
capable of being assembled to form trusses varying by increments of
11 feet up to a maximum span of about 90 feet. Two of these trusses
with the span mentioned were capable of supporting a load of 30 tons,
and they could be erected in a matter of hours over abutments prepared
in advance or extemporized from the ruins of a demolished
structure. These bridges had been manufactured in quantity in this
country and were ready for shipment when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>In the Argonne push Army bridge troops repaired and replaced
the bridges destroyed by the retreating enemy as fast as material
and labor could be provided at the points needed. For this work
much heavy timber was utilized, and, in general, trestle structures
were erected as best meeting the conditions of relatively soft crossings
and soft river bottoms.</p>

<p>The fighting in the French terrain with its numerous narrow but
deep streams and canals indicated to us the desirability of a portable
floating footbridge. Such a bridge was designed and produced by
the Engineers in France. Many of the crossings of the Meuse River
and near-by canals under machine-gun and artillery fire from the high
hills on the eastern side were made possible by the use of these bridges.</p>


<h4>CAMOUFLAGE.</h4>

<p>While camouflage has existed in nature since the beginning of time,
its application to warfare on a grand, scientific scale was almost
solely a development of the great war. Camouflage, due to the great
developments of aerial observation and aerophotography, as well as
of air bombing and indirect artillery fire, became a vital necessity for
every branch of the service, far back in the rear as well as at the
front. Any mat&eacute;riel or personnel the position of which was observed
was at the mercy of the enemy, but, further, such observation might
betray strategic plans. The need for camouflage became universal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>Camouflage organization was carefully developed for both the field
and the factory, while one of the most important duties, that of
instruction, was carried out in Army and corps schools and artillery
camps, where thousands of officers and men were taught both the
necessity and the methods of camouflage.</p>

<p>Our undertakings in this direction were based largely upon the
methods developed by the French and British. In one respect camouflage
was a matter of quantity production. This was in the manufacture
of material used for concealing guns, roads, and other strategic
locations which fall under the eyes of enemy observers on the ground
or in the air.</p>

<p>In this work the British did nothing without the most careful
scientific investigation, including the aerial photography of all their
materials used, while the French relied more on their innate artistic
sense of color and form. The camouflage material produced in quantity
by the British consisted principally of burlap cut in strips about
1 inch wide and 12 inches long, colored in the desired hues with
oil-emulsion paint. For artillery cover this was knotted in fish nets
and chicken wire. The French for this purpose used raffia, a common
product of Madagascar, whose natives use it largely for making their
fantastic garments. The raffia was dyed and then knotted on nets
and wire in the French camouflage factories.</p>

<p>After a careful study we adopted the British system and used
burlap. Our Engineers made this decision because of the impossibility
of finding permanent dyes for raffia and because raffia is more
inflammable than burlap and scarcer and higher in price.</p>

<p>The first demand for camouflage material which we received
embraced coverings for guns, sniper's suits, dummy heads, silhouettes,
and some airplane hangar covers. In order to supply this material
at the outset the engineering forces abroad leased a factory building
in Paris and turned out a sufficient quantity with a working force of
30 enlisted soldiers and 100 French women.</p>

<p>But, as the American troops at the front increased in number, the
demands for camouflage material became rapidly heavier. Battery
positions of some types required about 4,000 square yards of camouflage
cover. Aviation hangar covers were demanded in large numbers,
and each one was a special order due to the varying conditions
of terrain encountered. It became evident that we needed a vast
increase in our camouflage-factory space.</p>

<p>In January, 1918, the Engineers secured about 20 acres of ground
in Dijon, Haute Marne, a city on the main supply line north through
the regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. They started to erect buildings
immediately, and within 20 days this plant began turning out
material. By November the Dijon factory numbered about 40
buildings, including blacksmith and machine shop, a sewing shop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a paint shop, laboratory, and a toy shop where dummies and silhouettes
were made. The factory turned out artillery cover at
the rate of 50,000 square yards per day.</p>

<p>The total output of camouflage cover for all purposes required
about 3,000,000 square yards of burlap per month. When the
fighting stopped the American Expeditionary Forces were using
camouflage materials to the value of $1,500,000 monthly.</p>

<p>By new methods of manufacture, we succeeded in reducing the
weight of fish-net covers. We designed two important field devices,
one being an improved frame and set for mobile artillery protection,
this equipment being later adopted by the British, and the other
an umbrella machine-gun cover having special advantages. The
central camouflage works of the American Expeditionary Forces
at Dijon was declared by unprejudiced observers to be the best
equipped and most efficient of any on the western front.</p>

<p>When the Dijon camouflage plant was projected it was expected
that the American forces would require great quantities of camouflaged
observation posts, silhouettes, dummy heads, snipers' suits,
and other concealing devices. It was for this production that the
toy shop at Dijon was erected, this shop being a kind of studio for
the painters and sculptors connected with the Fortieth Engineers,
which was the camouflage regiment. These various devices for deceiving
the enemy, however, were used principally in the stagnant
action of the trench warfare deadlock. By the time American
forces came into the war in large numbers the struggle had become
one of movement in which the trenches were left far behind. Also,
American troops found themselves largely in sectors which were well
wooded and therefore provided plenty of secure observation. The
result was that there was never a great use on the part of American
troops of these clever and interesting exploits in camouflage with
which the public is familiar.</p>

<p>One of the best observation posts was the imitation of a tree
trunk made of armor plate and set up in advanced positions during
the night. Both the British and the French made considerable
use of these. The British tree consisted of an oval shell of manganese
steel. This was covered with tin, crimped in imitation of bark,
and further camouflaged with paint and plaster and natural bark.</p>

<p>When it was desired to set up such a post a camouflage artist would
surreptitiously make a faithful sketch of the tree trunk to be duplicated
in armor plate. This sketch was then taken back to the
workshop, where the spurious tree was built in exact duplication.
The metal tree was built to rest on a base with hinges holding it
down on one side. During the night two saps, or trenches, would be
dug to the natural tree selected. Workers in one of these trenches
would fell the branchless stub and carry it back out of the way.
The armor plate tree would be drawn up in the other trench. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
base would be set in place, and then the whole tree was raised on
its hinges by means of ropes until it was upright and as life-like
as artistry could make it. Inside the tree was a flight of iron steps
leading to a seat in the upper part of the trunk. At this seat were
peepholes and a stand for the phone which was connected up with
the exchange at the adjoining trench. The sap, covered over,
served as the gallery leading back to the trench.</p>

<p>The American camouflage force built only a single one of these
trees, using it as a training device. Such objects were useless in
an advancing movement, since, under such circumstances, they
would play an important part only a short while and would then
be left far in the rear.</p>

<p>The Dijon factory, however, turned out a number of small observation
posts for use at the edges of shell holes. These were known to
our troops as beehives and to the English soldiers as domes. Each
one was built of light metal and covered with chicken wire and
plaster. It was camouflaged with paint and bits of grass to simulate
the appearance of the surrounding terrain, often being studded with
tin cans or old shoes to make it appear to be an accumulation of
rubbish. The favorite way of making the peephole for a beehive
was to cover with gauze a hole cut in the bottom of an old shoe,
which was then fastened to the observation post.</p>

<p>Another device built by the Dijon factory was the trench periscope.
This was built and set up to look like an ordinary stick, thrown down
casually upon the ground. For periscopes, too, we also used
imitation stakes placed naturally in the barbed-wire entanglements.
The British on occasions used imitation trench telephone poles to
mask their periscopes.</p>

<p>The Dijon shop turned out large numbers of silhouettes and
dummies. They were drawn from life by artists at Dijon and then
cut out from ordinary wall board. Soldiers of the Fortieth Regiment
posed as models for these silhouettes. All sorts of postures were
employed, but nearly all of them represented soldiers in the act of
climbing out of a trench or running, gun in hand, towards the enemy.
The uniforms were painted in neutral shades, but the faces and hands
were highly colored to be visible at considerable distances during the
gray and mist of dawn, when silhouettes were usually employed.</p>

<p>The object of these dummy heads and silhouettes was to draw the
fire of the enemy so as to make him reveal his strength and positions.
The usual method of use was to place a number of silhouettes, possibly
several dozen of them, in shell holes out in front of the trenches.
The silhouettes were mounted so that they could be made to stand
erect instantly whenever the ropes were pulled from the trenches.
At the appointed moment the ropes would all be pulled at once, and
the appearance to the enemy would be that of a raiding party starting
out at top speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>The British troops called this operation the Chinese attack. The
Germans made no extensive employment of it. The silhouettes
nearly always fooled the enemy, as indeed they would deceive anybody
in such light and under such circumstances. The British
were often amused to read in the German communiques that these
Chinese attacks were regarded by the enemy as the real thing. More
than one such "repulse" of silhouettes has gone down into the German
records as a local success. On one occasion the Germans took a
Chinese attack so seriously that they concentrated troops against it
with the result that the British were able to gain considerable ground
at the points weakened on both sides of the pseudo attack.</p>

<p>The Dijon factory made a thousand or so silhouettes, as well as a
large number of dummy heads, these latter devices to draw the fire
of snipers. These simulacra, however, had their principal use at the
training schools in France, since they were peculiarly adapted to
trench warfare, and by the time the American forces reached the
front in strength the war of movement was in progress.</p>

<p>Several thousand sniper suits were turned out at Dijon. These
suits were made of burlap, resembling in appearance the teddy-bear
pajamas which little children wear. They were colored to match the
terrain, either painted to resemble rocks or fitted with a grasslike
covering. An adjunct to this suit was the cloth cover for the sniper's
rifle.</p>

<p>Sniper suits were so deceptive that they would protect a man
from observation even at short distances, and if exceptional care
were used in the making of one, a man could conceal himself so
effectually that an observer might step on him before seeing him.
An American camouflage officer upon his return from France brought
a sniper's suit with him and found a novel but practical use for it
when he was invited to go duck hunting with a party of sportsmen.
The other hunters stayed in their blinds, but the officer in the sniper
suit went out in the open and shot more ducks than all the other
gunners together were able to bring down.</p>

<p>The Dijon camouflage factory also turned out a large number of
covers for the so-called Bessenaux hangars for airplanes. These
hangars were large tents set up at aviation fields near the front. It
was soon found to be impracticable to attempt to camouflage such
tents by day, as they gave plenty of indication of their position in
spite of the best efforts at concealment on the American and allied
sides. However, the great danger at aviation fields came at night
when the German bombing planes were abroad. Even on a dark
night a white tent proved to be a good mark for the hostile airmen.
Consequently the attempt was made to camouflage Bessenaux hangars
at night only. It was found impracticable to paint the tents
themselves, since the waterproof canvas would not take the paint
readily. The solution was a large cover of burlap. This was painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in broken patches of color, much as artillery was painted in camouflage.
At the factory such covers were spread out on the ground and
painted with floor brushes dipped into water color.</p>

<p>All machinery at Dijon, with the exception of two lathes, two drill
presses, and a shearing machine, was designed and built at the plant
itself. The work of providing camouflage cover required enormous
quantities of burlap to be cut up into strips. The English camouflage
shops used stationary knives and a machine operated by a
crank. American Engineers at Dijon designed a power-driven
cutting machine with a large number of circular, whirling knife
blades. The invention of this machine increases the production of
burlap strips 900 per cent with the same force. The engineers at the
plant also designed paint tanks and special machinery that would
mix 4,000 gallons of color in a day.</p>

<p>There were about 1,000 French women employed in this plant.
The executives paid great attention to their welfare. A special
nursery, the "Creche," was built for their children. American Red
Cross nurses cared for the babies during the time their mothers
were at work. Many of the women employed were refugees driven
from once comfortable homes. Their children fattened up with
the good food provided by the army mess, and the mothers were
correspondingly happy. Entertainments were frequently provided
for the operators of the factories. The artists at the shop worked
during their leisure moments and eventually produced the scenery
and equipment for a genuine Yankee circus, animals and all, the
menagerie, however, being made principally of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; with
human operatives inside the beasts. The first performance of the
circus was given on Thanksgiving Day, 1918, and the audience was so
delighted that it demanded a repetition. After three encores of this
sort it was suggested that performances be given in Dijon, a city of
upward of 50,000 population, with admittance charged. This advice
was followed, and the circus made such a hit that the Engineers
were able to turn over to the French orphan fund a considerable sum
of money.</p>


<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p>The foregoing account gives in a broad way an idea of the scope
of activities and the achievements of the Engineers during the
19 months of actual warfare in France. To furnish the organization
of technical troops and specialists which made all this possible,
the original Engineer Arm of the United States Army was increased
to 131.5 times its prewar strength, and the proportion of Engineer
troops relative to the total forces was increased from 1.6 per cent
to 10.8 per cent. To accomplish this, a heavy demand was made
upon the technical professions and upon the industries of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
country. In filling this demand most necessary assistance was
given by the engineer societies and the engineering journals, whose
patriotic work demands the highest praise.</p>

<p>In situations requiring special knowledge almost always there
could be found some specialist capable of adapting himself and
his work to the military needs. Engineer officers for the combatant
regiments were younger members of the technical professions, who
were sent to the training camps provided for the purpose and there
given the essentials of strictly military knowledge. This training
was later supplemented by courses in Engineer and line schools
located in France. The training officers of the regiments were
supplied from the Corps of Engineers, these men having both the
military and technical knowledge fitting them for the command.
The diversity of education and experience necessary in all branches
of the Engineer service may be understood by a consideration of
the duties of the different units sent to France during the war&mdash;specialist
units, in addition to the strictly combatant divisional
regiments, who also numbered among their commissioned and
enlisted personnel many technical specialists of high attainment.</p>

<p>We had, for instance, seven railway construction regiments, two
railway construction battalions, one regiment and five battalions
for railway maintenance of way, two battalions for maintenance
of railway equipment, four regiments and one battalion to operate
our main military railways in France, three regiments to operate
the light railways in France and their repair shops, two regiments
for operating the regular railway shops, two regiments and six
battalions for constructing buildings and other general construction
work, two regiments for storing and transporting Engineer supplies,
a forestry regiment, a light railway construction regiment, a regiment
for building roads, a water supply regiment, a mining regiment,
a quarrying regiment, a technical regiment for handling
surveying, sound ranging, and location of enemy positions by means
of special apparatus, three survey and printing battalions, two
railway transportation battalions, an electrical and mechanical
regiment, several companies to operate cranes, a camouflage service,
five inland waterway companies, five ponton trains, a ponton park,
a railway transportation and stores battalion, and a searchlight
regiment.</p>

<p>Utilizing and applying the new knowledge and scientific achievements
of recent years, drawing upon the fund of experience acquired
by the Regular Army in its theoretical studies and past wars, making
available the vast amount of technical skill which has assisted this
Nation to its present commercial and industrial status, the Engineers
of the United States Army worked and fought, planned, and accomplished
in France a work which in magnitude exceeds any similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
undertaking recorded in American history. From base port to first
waves of an assault upon the enemy's position, Engineer troops have
been constantly in action first to last and have "carried on" always
with the high ideals of the profession and with the motto of the Corps
of Engineers, "<i>Essayons</i>," before them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

MILITARY RAILWAYS.</h3>


<p>In establishing contact between our great bases of supply on
the French coast and interior points, as well as with the fighters in
the various fields of operations, the Department of Military Railways
of the Engineer Corps found it necessary to provide thousands of miles
of railway track ranging from the standard gauge down to the narrow
60-centimeter type built right up to the border of No Man's Land, to
construct and ship across seas thousands of almost every kind of freight
cars, to build hundreds of locomotives and transport them to Europe,
to provide in addition fabricated track that could be laid under heavy
shell fire, and hospital trains that could care for our wounded.</p>

<p>It was on July 10, 1917, that Gen. Pershing cabled stating that the
French had asked for 300 locomotives and 2,000 kilometers of track,
in addition to numerous items of accessories that go with an order of
this size. Delivery of the locomotives was requested by October 15,
1917, and of the track by December 31, 1917.</p>

<p>It was ascertained that the American Locomotive Works had built
consolidation engines for France of an entirely satisfactory type, and
that similar locomotives for the use of British forces on French soil
had been turned out by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. After the
decision to adopt the consolidation type of locomotive, which is
generally used in freight service in the United States, arrangements
were made at once with these two concerns to build 150 locomotives
each.</p>

<p>The consolidation locomotive weighs 166,400 pounds, and is about
the heaviest that can be used in France. It has one pair of engine
truck wheels and four pairs of drivers. The engine is just as large as
it is possible to use within the French tunnel and platform clearances.
The type sent to France was, however, not nearly so large nor so heavy
as the general run of freight engines used here.</p>

<p>The order for 150 engines was placed with the Baldwin concern on
July 19, 1917, and the first locomotive of this order was ready for
shipment on August 10, 1917, just 20 working days elapsing between
the date of the placing of the order and the day when the first engine
was completed and all set up ready for shipment.</p>

<p>This is believed to have established a new record for locomotive
construction in the United States and probably in the world for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
engine of this size. All the other locomotives in this order were
delivered promptly&mdash;36 of the Baldwin engines being freighted from
the factory in August, 71 in September, and the final 43 in October.
Of the locomotives ordered from the American Locomotive Works,
133 were freighted in October and the remaining 17 in November.</p>

<p>On account of differences in the details of construction the original
price fixed for the locomotives turned out by the American Locomotive
Works was $51,000 each and for those of the Baldwin Works
$46,000 apiece. Advance payments on these engines reduced the
price by $1,000 each.</p>

<p>Changes in the painting and other small details resulted in a saving
of $60 additional on each locomotive built by the Baldwin Works
and $400 on each engine turned out by the American Works, so that
the net cost of each Baldwin locomotive was $44,940, and of each
American locomotive $49,600.</p>

<p>After much consideration, and after this initial order had been disposed
of, it was determined that the Baldwin type of engine should
be made the standard, and all subsequent orders for engines went to
the Baldwin Works.</p>

<p>As orders were placed from time to time with the Baldwin people,
reductions were made in price, so that the last engines of the total of
3,340 ordered from this concern were obtained for $37,000 each.
Orders for 1,500 of these engines eventually were canceled without
cost to the United States Government. The saving effected by the
reduction in price on the engines ordered, using the original price as
a basis of comparison, was $22,989,385.</p>

<p>There were shipped in all to the American Expeditionary Forces
1,303 locomotives, of which 908 had been put into service by November
11, 1918.</p>

<p>During the severe winter weather of 1917-18 and the simultaneous
shortage of motive power on American railways, 142 of these consolidation
engines built for the American Expeditionary Forces were
turned over to the American railways to help out a critical situation
in this country. It was possible to use these engines here by making
changes in the couplers and some other slight additions to meet the
requirements of our safety appliance laws.</p>

<p>At the time these engines were turned over to the Railway Administration
we were producing locomotives for France much more
rapidly than it was possible to provide tonnage to transport them
overseas. These locomotives were in service helping out the transportation
facilities in this country an average of 6 months and 28
days each before being recalled for shipment to France. They earned
profits for the Government while in service for the Railroad Administration
at the rate of 32.3 per cent a year.</p>

<p>It might also be noted that the Director General of Military Railways
was appointed custodian of undelivered locomotives ordered
by the Russian government from the Baldwin and American Works.
In January, 1918, a total of 200 of these Russian locomotives was
purchased, and the engines were converted to meet American
requirements by a change in the gauge from 5 feet to 4 feet, 8&frac12;
inches, and a change in the coupling system to meet our standard.
The price of these was $55,000 each. The Baldwin Works turned
its 100 over to the Railroad Administration between February 3 and
May 20, 1918, and the American Works made its deliveries between
February 19 and May 30, 1918.</p>

<p>The combined cost of these locomotives was $11,000,000 and their
total rental revenue from the railroads was $2,585,475 up to December
31, 1918, or 23.5 per cent of the cost price, or at the rental
rate of 29.8 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>Orders for 90,103 freight cars to be used by the American Expeditionary
Forces were also placed with American contractors. Of
these the orders for nearly half&mdash;40,915 cars, in exact figures&mdash;had
been placed just before the armistice, and these contracts were
canceled at slight cost to the Government. Up to the end of the
year 1918 a total of 18,313 freight cars had been shipped overseas,
nearly all of these cars being of the 60,000-pound size. Close bargaining
in the purchase of these cars resulted in a saving of $15,737,633
under the prices originally quoted.</p>

<p>For the first time in history American locomotives were shipped
across the Atlantic stacked in ships on their own wheels. In our
normal foreign trade, and even in the early locomotive shipments
to the American Expeditionary Forces, both engines and cars had
been disassembled at the seaboard and their parts put up in packages
for convenient and economical loading on ships. Each of the
first locomotives sent to France was crated in 19 packages, while the
parts for an ordinary box car were put up in 26 packages.</p>

<p>On October 29, 1917, however, Gen. Atterbury called attention to
the fact that the English were shipping locomotives across the
Channel on their own wheels and stated that it would result in
very great economies of time, money, and man power if such an
arrangement could be made for shipments from the United States.
Manufacturers of the locomotives, however, advised against this.
So did our own embarkation people and the Shipping Control Committee.
Efforts were unsuccessful to get car ferries from the Key
West and Habana line and from Quebec for the transport of locomotives
on their own wheels over the ocean.</p>

<p>Finally, however, after numerous efforts to get ships with large
hatches the ore steamer <i>Feltore</i> was loaded with 33 locomotives on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
their own wheels, packed in baled hay. This steamer sailed May
18, 1918, and its arrival in France resulted in the following cable
from Gen. Pershing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shipment of erected locomotives transmitted on the <i>Feltore</i> very satisfactory. Boat
completely discharged of locomotives and cargoes in 13 days with saving of 15 ship's
days in unloading the 33 locomotives erected as compared with same number of locomotives
not erected and further saving of 14 days of erecting forces. Observations of
Capt. Byron, who came with these locomotives, show that by loading locomotives in
double tiers, placing cab parts and tools, now in separate packages, within tender
space and fire boxes, 40 to 45 locomotives can be loaded.</p></div>

<p>Subsequently the steamers <i>Cubore</i>, <i>Firmore</i>, and <i>Santore</i> were assigned
to the task of carrying these engines over on their own wheels.
The total number of locomotives that went abroad in this manner
was 533. After the signing of the armistice we sold the French Government
485 locomotives, of which 142 had been shipped up to January
1, 1919.</p>

<p>Efforts were likewise made to ship over freight cars already set
up but this was also met with much objection. Finally, 1,000 cars
were built to go over complete but the signing of the armistice
stopped the shipment. The saving in the cost of shipping locomotives
on their own wheels amounted to $775 for each one, and an
average of $20 a car would have been saved by sending the cars over
on their own wheels. But, in addition to this, the cost of erection
on the other side, amounting to $800 for each locomotive, should also
be added to the saving.</p>

<p>The number of cars actually shipped overseas for the American
Expeditionary Forces, if made into one solid train, would be 140
miles long.</p>

<p>In August, 1918, there came a call from abroad to produce locomotives
at the rate of 300 a month and freight cars at the rate of
8,200 monthly. Machinery for getting this production was started
at once and was so effectual that during the months of September and
October and up to the signing of the armistice engines were actually
being produced and shipped from the Baldwin Locomotive Works
at this rate. This company was turning out the greatest number of
locomotives ever produced by any one company in the same length
of time.</p>

<p>Arrangements for increasing production of freight cars to meet
every possibility of tonnage facilities on the ocean were also made,
and had the armistice not been signed we had planned to produce
during the month of December 11,000 complete freight cars and to
maintain this production rate until we had filled all orders from
Gen. Pershing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>On our first purchase of rails, amounting to 102,000 tons, the price
paid was $38 a ton for Bessemer steel and $40 a ton for open-hearth
steel, as against a price of $59 a ton that the Russians were paying and
prices between $54.36 and $61.87 that were being paid by the French.
There was a saving in this item of approximately $2,040,000 as compared
with the prices paid by the Russians and of $1,938,000 compared
with the prices paid by the French.</p>

<p>In connection with our first purchase of this steel rail, it should be
stated that the Lackawanna Steel Co. and the United States Steel
Products Co. agreed to sell us rail on this basis. Orders were placed
with these companies, but not with two other companies&mdash;the Cambria
Steel Co. and the Bethlehem Steel Co.&mdash;who declined to accept
the price offered.</p>

<p>All subsequent orders for steel rail were on the basis of $55 and $57
a ton for Bessemer and open hearth, respectively, which figure was
established by the War Industries Board pursuant to the Government
policy to stabilize industry by establishing fixed prices alike for all
purchasers&mdash;the Government itself, the allies, and the public.</p>

<p>A total of 937 miles of standard-gauge railway track was laid in
France with material shipped from this country.</p>

<p>A big money saving was effected by changing the design of the
freight cars asked for by our overseas forces. Their original call was
for 17,000 four-wheel cars of the French type, these varying from 10 to
20 tons capacity per car. Our investigations here convinced us that
the American type of car with 30-ton capacity could be used on the
French railroads. Consequently we recommended that 6,000 of the
30-ton American-type cars be sent abroad instead of smaller-capacity
French cars. Our recommendation was approved by officers abroad,
and as a result there was a saving of $12,640,000 in the cost of this
initial order of cars. From that time all cars shipped from the United
States were of the American 8-wheel type, a fact which resulted in a
saving of approximately $189,600,000 over what it would have cost
to build and ship the lighter French cars.</p>

<p>Had the light French type of cars, as originally suggested, been
adopted, 270,309 cars would have been required instead of 90,103
cars, and probably twice as much tonnage would have been necessary
to transport these cars overseas.</p>

<p>Most of the steel rails were purchased from the Cambria Steel Co.,
the Lackawanna Steel Co., the Bethlehem Steel Co., the United States
Steel Products Co., and the Sweets Steel Co. Raised pier, gantry,
and locomotive cranes were turned out by the several crane builders
in proportion to their ability to produce. The Standard Steel Car
Co. made millions of dollars' worth of metallic parts for freight cars,
and the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co. produced rails and bars. As previously
mentioned, the Baldwin Locomotive Works got the bulk of
the orders for locomotives, although the American Locomotive Co.,
the Vulcan Co., the H. E. Porter Co., and the Davenport Locomotive
Works also made locomotives for our Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>


<h4>HOSPITAL TRAINS.</h4>

<p>Ambulance trains were called for by Gen. Pershing in his cablegram
of July 15, 1917. It was stated in this message that plans for these
ambulance trains would be furnished by the Surgeon General of the
Army.</p>

<p>To build these ambulance trains, with their complicated designs
and specialized equipment, in this country would have entailed
lengthy delay and very heavy expense, as after they had been constructed
it would have been necessary to knock them down for shipment.
With this fact in mind our officers here took up the question
with Sir Francis Dent, of the British railway commission, who was
in this country at the time. He stated that ambulance trains built
by the London &amp; North Western Railway, which had proved
wholly satisfactory in three years of service, could be turned out by
that same concern there quickly if the English design were adopted
for our Army.</p>

<p>After considerable discussion and consideration the English design
was followed, and orders for our ambulance trains were placed abroad.
Up to December 7, 1918, there had been completed for our Army 19
of these trains, with a total of 304 cars, and there were in the course
of completion at that time or under order 29 additional ambulance
trains.</p>

<p>Information from England shows that it was indeed the part of
wisdom to order these ambulance trains abroad, as figures from
England stated that the first 14 of these trains were produced at a
cost to us of &pound;3,845 per car, including repair parts. This means that
at the present rate of exchange the cost of each coach was $18,302.20,
while to have built these cars in this country, knocked them down,
and shipped them overseas would have cost $40,000 each.</p>


<h4>NARROW-GAUGE RAILWAY EQUIPMENT&mdash;FABRICATED STEEL TRACK.</h4>

<p>The urgent necessity for narrow-gauge railway equipment for our
armed forces in Europe was first brought home to us when Gen.
Pershing cabled on July 15, 1917. In this message he asked for large
quantities of 60-centimeter locomotives, cars, and track. The types
requested were entirely new in this country.</p>

<p>Specifically, there were required 195 60-centimeter steam locomotives
with a low center of gravity and with a maximum of 3&frac12; tons
axle load; 126 40-horsepower gasoline locomotives; 63 20-horsepower
gasoline locomotives; and 3,332 freight cars of various types,
including box cars and flat cars of 10-ton capacity, tank cars, and
dump cars. To aid in the building of this new equipment many
photographs and designs brought over from France were used.
It was decided to build the 10-ton cars fitted with small 4-wheel
trucks at each end, rather than to make them of the 4-wheeled type,
as with this construction they would be better adapted for the
rounding of short curves.</p>

<p>In turning out the different kinds of locomotives for the 60-centimeter
railways new designs were made in order to produce locomotives
that would run with equal facility in either direction.
For the gasoline locomotives, designs of types similar to standard-gauge
engines, a few of which had been in the service in this country,
were made, and orders were placed with the Baldwin Locomotive
Works for the first lot.</p>

<p>The first steam locomotives were delivered by the builders on
October 3, 1917, and the first gas locomotives on November 7, 1917.</p>

<p>Orders for the freight cars for these narrow-gauge railways were
placed with a number of the larger car-building companies of the
country. The first of these cars were delivered November 24, 1917.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed a total of 1,841 locomotives and
11,229 cars of the narrow-gauge type had been ordered and 427
locomotives and 6,134 cars completed. Up to the 11th of November
361 of the locomotives and 5,691 of the cars had been shipped
overseas.</p>

<p>Of the 361 locomotives sent to France, 191 were steam engines, 108
had 50-horsepower gasoline engines, and 62 had 35-horsepower
gasoline engines. Of the 5,691 cars that went to the Expeditionary
Forces prior to the signing of the armistice, 600 were box cars, 166
were tank cars, 500 were flat cars, 1,555 were 8-wheeled gondola cars,
330 were dump cars, 100 were artillery truck cars, 970 were motor
cars, 180 were inspection cars, 300 were hand cars, and 990 were
push cars.</p>

<p>For the construction of the narrow-gauge railroad used in the
combat areas behind the front line trenches a special type of fabricated
track was designed. This consisted of short sections of rail
bolted to steel crossties. The American narrow-gauge railway was
so arranged that it could be packed in knockdown shape to save
shipping space. Most of this track was in 5-meter lengths, although
many shorter sections were used. All, however, were in multiples
of 1&frac14; meters, accurately sawed so as to insure absolute fit of intermediate
sections when shell fire made replacement necessary.
Vast quantities of curved track, as well as innumerable switches
and turnouts, also were built.</p>

<p>In all about 605 miles of fabricated, narrow-gauge steel track were
purchased and 460 miles shipped to France. All but 192 miles of
the fabricated track was built at the Lakewood Engineering Co.,
near Cleveland. The balance was obtained through the United
States Steel Products Co. The cost of the straight track was about
$7,400 a mile, while the cost of the curved sections was $8,000 a mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of this narrow-gauge track that went to France was manufactured
at the rate of between 5 and 6 miles of completed track
a day.</p>

<p>Great quantities of the fabricated track produced by the Lakewood
Engineering Co. were loaded upon camouflaged steamers in
Cleveland in May, 1918, and sent direct to France, via Lake Erie,
the Welland Canal, and the St. Lawrence River.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

ENGINEER ACTIVITIES AT HOME.</h3>


<p>A vast quantity of motorized or portable equipment was required
by the Engineer units of the American Expeditionary Forces and
this had in the main to be furnished under the supervision of the
Engineers in this country. The extent to which this material was
produced is shown by such items as 6,923 trucks of all kinds, 2,082
portable buildings, 124 portable shop and material trucks, 51 portable
pile drivers, 90 electric storage trucks, 6,006 boilers, and 3,504
dump cars. Two-thirds of this equipment was shipped overseas before
the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>The development of mobile shops was one of the most interesting
phases of this branch of engineering work. Quite early in the war,
when we began the construction of the great base shops in France,
we developed these portable machine shops, blacksmith shops,
carpenter shops, and storeroom shops in demountable truck bodies,
to be used for general service in the field. The shops were so constructed
that they could be entirely closed up when the unit was in
motion; but when the shop was ready for use the sides and ends
of the inclosing structure were lowered, forming work tables when
the shop was left on the truck chassis. If the shop were entirely
demounted, these sides and ends, let down, formed extensions of
the floor. With this arrangement a wide range of general repair
and construction work could be handled on the spot on short notice.
If it were necessary for the shop to stay in one place for several
days or weeks, the body could be demounted, and the truck chassis
was then used for transporting materials to and from the shop.</p>

<p>Each portable shop contained about 800 different items of tools
and equipment. Each was mounted on a 5&frac12; ton truck. The
portable machine shop contained a workbench, a drill press, a portable
electric drill, a grinder, and a 14-inch lathe, these being operated
by an electric power plant carried on the truck; and it also had an
equipment of necessary small tools and supplies, including an oxyacetylene
welding outfit.</p>

<p>The portable blacksmith, plumbing, and tin shops each contained a
workbench, forges, hoists, pipe-fitting machines, a shear and punch,
vises, and a welding and cutting outfit, together with a power plant
and switchboard and the necessary small tools and supplies. The
portable carpenter shop contained boring machines, a drill press, a
bench grinder, a workbench, a saw bench, a winch, power plant and
switchboard, small tools and supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>A complete machine shop on wheels cost the Government about
$8,500. The carpenter shop cost $7,600. As supply units for the
portable shops, the Government built 30 material trucks, each
containing about 600 items of tools and supplies. These material
trucks cost $6,100 apiece.</p>

<p>Another successful development of this nature was the portable
photolithographic press truck, already referred to in the account of
the American Expeditionary Forces' lithographic equipment. These
automobile presses, which were at our front soon after our troops
went into the trenches, were able to print and distribute lithographic
sketches and maps within 12 hours after the original sketches were
submitted for reproduction. The French and British armies also
had mobile photolithographic units which were much less portable
than ours and much slower in operation. The best time made by
the French and British outfits was four days for the same work.</p>

<p>We also supplied to the Engineering forces abroad special water
sterilizers and water tanks, mounted on trucks. The Engineers put
small job-printing shops on trucks and photographic dark rooms on
trucks for use in the field.</p>

<p>They equipped trucks with derricks, capstans, and wrecking machinery.
They furnished automotive road sprinklers and oilers, as
well as trucks with special dump bodies for highway work.</p>

<p>They developed a light, portable pile driver unlike anything used
theretofore in commercial work. This machine was constructed of
structural steel and had a total weight of 4 tons. It was mounted on
a truck drawn by horses or mules, and the pile driver itself was operated
by a 25-horsepower gasoline engine. The pile driver could be
used within 16 minutes after its arrival at any point.</p>

<p>One development of this sort, the mobile clam-shell derrick, is
worth noting. This unique piece of machinery was built by the
Winther Motor Truck Co., of Kenosha, Wis. When the American
Expeditionary Forces issued a requisition for 120 clam-shell derricks
mounted on motor trucks, no such piece of equipment was in existence
anywhere on earth. The Winther Co. volunteered to attempt
to produce the machine. By giving a wider tread of rear axle to the
Winther motor truck, the company could provide a suitable vehicle,
but, search as they might, they could not find a derrick of sufficient
power to operate a half-yard clam shell and also light enough to
mount on a 7-ton truck. No such derrick existed. The company,
therefore, without knowing anything about the manufacture of derricks,
put its engineering force to work to produce a design. This
design was developed in two weeks, and the derrick built from it was
less than half the weight of any derrick of equal capacity. After
being perfected, the mobile derrick in tests showed that it could move
350 cubic yards of sand or gravel per day or 500 or 600 tons of coal.
One man could operate it and the motive power was a 4-cylinder
gasoline engine.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>The Engineering Department approved this design and ordered
32 such clam-shell units. Nine of these were delivered before the
armistice was signed. The company has continued production of
these derricks with a view of selling them to road builders and
excavators in civil life.</p>

<p>For use of the various Engineer units we manufactured 1,610 tool
wagons and shipped most of them to France. Because of the rough
nature of the shell-torn ground over which these wagons must be used,
we designed each to be uncoupled and operated as two 2-wheeled
carts.</p>

<p>The development of mobile industrial units mounted on motor trucks
is likely to have a profound effect on American industry in the future.
For instance, the special derrick or crane trucks which we built are
almost certain to be adopted in commercial use. The locomotive
crane has always been a useful machine, but its chief use has been in
handling heavy materials which were being loaded on or off railway
cars. A crane which can be moved rapidly to places where railway
tracks are not located should be of almost equal importance. An
accompanying illustration shows in operation one of the derrick
trucks which we built for overseas use.</p>

<p>In the same way the mobile pile drivers designed by the Engineer
Corps should be of great future service in road building in this country.</p>

<p>The various machine shops which were built for war purposes will,
in their duplications and adaptations, undoubtedly serve a useful
purpose in future commercial activities in this country. The increased
use of motive power on farms has created a demand for machine repairs.
The day may come when the traveling machine shop will be a
familiar sight on our rural highways.</p>

<p>The Engineer troops required a great quantity of hoisting machinery.
Our purchases in this respect amounted to 700 cranes,
mostly of the locomotive type, and 886 hoisting engines, at a total
cost of $4,996,000. About two-thirds of this equipment was sent to
France and installed at the ports of debarkation and at depots. The
rest was used at the shipping points in this country. This machinery
was of great aid in the rapid handling of materials at tidewater.</p>

<p>A vast amount of small tools and construction material was required.</p>

<p>Some 21,000 tons of barbed wire, shipped abroad to be used principally
in the construction of entanglements in front of American
battle positions, were manufactured principally by the United States
Steel Products Co., Jones &amp; Laughlin, the Gulf States Steel Co.,
and the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co., although several other firms also
supplied barbed wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>The Engineering Department ordered in the United States, during
the fighting, equipment and supplies which cost approximately
$754,201,407.</p>

<p>We furnished in all 85,120 steel shelters of various sizes, of which
38,320 were of the individual type which could be carried by one
man. The steel used in these individual shelters was about one-eighth
of an inch thick.</p>

<p>There may be expected to be great incidental benefit to future
American industry from improvements and inventions brought out
by American military engineering in 1917 and 1918.</p>

<p>One important work, for instance, which the Engineer Department
undertook was that of standardizing the requirements for paints and
varnishes. At the outset our Army needs ran into 29 shades of color
in 315 different paint and varnish mixtures. Without affecting any
of our camouflage projects or other important undertakings, we reduced
the number of shades required from 29 to 16 and brought the
total number of commodities down from 315 to 99. This reduction
in the range of commodities will be of great use to the paint and varnish
industry in the future.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the mechanical rubber industry had
but few standard specifications. The Engineers, after considerable
research, developed 30 standard specifications for mechanical rubber
goods, which class included such materials as hose, packing, and
sleeves. The representatives of the rubber industry verbally stated
that the Engineer Department in this short time did more good to
the trade than it had been able to accomplish for itself in the previous
three or four years of effort. Immediately after hostilities stopped
rubber concerns began asking the Engineer Department for its standard
specifications.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of hardware and kitchen utensils there was
also considerable standardization done, and changes in manufacturing
methods were recommended which were put into effect by the producers.
All spun goods were eliminated, and the industry confined
itself to straight stamping, which meant a reduction in labor. A
standard cobalt coating for enamelware was developed by which the
industry conserved about 30 tons of nitre per month and made a more
durable and satisfactory enamel coating, with the result that to-day
the Army is purchasing its vast quantities of enamelware subject to
certain tests, whereas, in the past, practically all this material was
bought purely upon the manufacturers' statements. The shortage of
tin was of considerable importance. Upon the recommendation of
an Engineer officer enormous quantities of cafeteria trays were coated
with zinc and large amounts of tin thereby conserved. The finished
tray was entirely satisfactory and gave essentially the same service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
as that plated with tin. Horseshoe nails, formerly a variable product,
were standardized and tested, and methods were devised by which
the Army was enabled to control their quality.</p>

<p>Before the war there was no standard rating for internal-combustion
engines, each manufacturer rating his motors according to his
own ideas. Our studies of small engines of the type used for driving
pumps or operating woodworking and metal-working machines
resulted in many improvements, which have been adopted by the
manufacturers of internal-combustion engines. Out of these studies
came the so-called army rating, a standard which is bound to result
in the more careful rating of commercial engines.</p>

<p>The Engineer Department brought out a modification of the design
of the existing line of gasoline-driven shovels by applying caterpillar
traction to the larger sizes, thus doing away with the labor required
to plank up and block shovels that move on wheels.</p>

<p>When we entered the war, the explosive trinitrotoluol was standard
for our Army for mining and demolition purposes. The Bureau of
Mines, in cooperation with the Engineer Department, developed an
explosive which is cheaper than T. N. T. and promises to replace it
for engineering operations.</p>

<p>We also improved the devices commercially used in electrical detonation
of distributed charges, our improved detonators being more
certain and reliable than anything in use.</p>

<p>Commercial machines for detonating as many as 250 standard
No. 8 caps were developed for the Panama Canal, but the machines
in common use had seen little improvement for 25 years. As a result
of the development by the Engineer Corps, a machine capable of
detonating 120 caps was obtained, weighing no more than the 30-cap
commercial blasting machine and costing slightly less.</p>

<p>A second machine was developed, capable of exploding 500 caps,
at a price not greatly above the price of a 30-cap commercial machine.
Mining engineers who saw this development stated that it would have
a high commercial value, as these improved machines would make
electric blasting more positive and dependable than any other form
of detonation, as well as making it possible to set off a large series of
charges simultaneously. The Panama Canal machine weighed 35
pounds and cost $126. Our 500-cap machine weighed 30 pounds
and cost $35. The du Pont 30-cap machine weighed 25 pounds and
cost $25. Our small machine weighed 20 pounds, cost $22.50, and
would fire 120 caps.</p>

<p>In addition to this there might be mentioned other projects
developed primarily for war purposes but which will be available
for the industrial uses of peace. These included portable well-drilling
outfits of a new type, alcohol stills of a small size for the
utilization of waste products in small units, sound reducers on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
exhaust pipes of gasoline engines, air strainers to minimize the
chances of dust and grit entering gasoline engines. When the war
ended we were working on the problem of hastening the setting of
concrete and were also studying the production in this country of
photographic colors and tone chemicals formerly secured only from
Germany.</p>

<p>In general, mention should be made of the exhaustive tests in
many industries conducted by the Engineer depot and by special
detachments of Engineers. Tests were made of hundreds of pieces
of apparatus, and these tests led to many improvements in American
manufacture. Illustrating how these tests were regarded by individual
concerns, the Cleveland Tractor Co., after a test of its equipment
conducted by Army Engineers, stated: "Our people consider this
test to be the most valuable ever undertaken by this company."
This is indicative of benefits scattered throughout American industry
by the engineering war tests.</p>

<p>While practically all of the research work which resulted in the
developments and improvements noted was conducted by Engineer
officers while on duty at the General Engineer Depot in Washington,
since the transfer of the functions of the General Engineer Depot to
the Division of Purchase, Storage and Traffic, November 1, 1918,
much of this research work has been and still is being carried on by
the latter division.</p>

<p>For handling Engineer materials there were established the General
Engineer Depot at Washington, D. C, embarkation depots at South
Kearney, N. J., and Norfolk, Va., and shipping depots at Baltimore,
Md., Philadelphia, Pa., Jacksonville, Fla., New Orleans, La., and
Mobile, Ala. In addition, subdepots were organized at all of the
divisional camps and cantonments.</p>

<p>The war demanded the production in America of quantities of
precision instruments. These were required not only by the Ordnance
Department for the equipment of artillery with sights and
indirect fire-control apparatus but also by the Engineer Corps, the
Signal Corps, the Bureau of Aircraft Production, and the Medical
Department. These instruments were such things as aneroid barometers,
pocket compasses, measuring tapes, surveyors' equipment
generally, map-drawing outfits, draftsmen's supplies, and so on. For
a large period of the war the procurement of precision instruments
was in the hands of the General Engineer Depot. Later, when the
War Department's supply activities were being consolidated, the
purchasing of precision instruments, except the highly technical
sound-ranging devices, was taken over by the Director of Purchase
and Storage, the organization of the General Engineer Depot going
along in the transfer. The development and the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
searchlights and sound-ranging apparatus remained in the hands of
the Engineer Corps.</p>

<p>In April, 1917, there were probably not more than a dozen recognized
American manufacturers of high-grade precision instruments. As an
indication of the expansion of manufacturing capacity required by
the war, one concern, the Taylor Instrument Cos., of Rochester,
N. Y., which had manufactured in peace times watch-pocket compasses
at the rate of 15,000 a year, were called upon to turn them out
at the rate of 10,000 weekly to fill an order for 200,000 of them. In
order to handle this contract the Taylor Instrument Cos. built a new
factory building in 20 days. A certain type of aneroid barometer
required by the exigencies had never before been produced in America.
The Taylor Instrument Cos. succeeded in producing 1,240 of these
barometers.</p>

<p>The Lufkin Rule Co., of Saginaw, Mich., was called upon to manufacture
700 band chain measuring tapes for surveying, graduated
throughout according to the metric system, and also 1,240 special
outfits for repairing such tape. These band tapes when broken are fastened
together by tiny rivets, which are produced by special machinery.
Because of the inability of the machine-tool industry, swamped as
it was with war demands, to produce the special rivet-making machines,
it was necessary to reduce in the specifications for repair outfits
the quantity of metal rivets for each kit from 4 ounces of rivets
to 2 ounces.</p>

<p>Field artillery required a precision instrument known as the miniature
telescopic alidade of the Gale type. It is unlikely that 150 of
these instruments had been made in the United States during 10
years, yet the Artillery demands called for the production of 1,110
of them. The W. &amp; L. E. Gurley Co., of Troy, N. Y., not only manufactured
half of this order, but, in order that the Government might
obtain a sufficient supply of these instruments, it turned over to a
competing firm, the Eugene Dietzgen Co., of Chicago, the lenses,
prisms, hermetically-sealed bubbles, and other parts for 555 instruments.</p>

<p>The Army required large numbers of hand tally registers to be
used by checkers and observers. The Benton Manufacturing Co., of
New York, had been making less than 15,000 registers of this sort in
a year, yet it increased its facilities and turned out 62,000 of them
for the Army within two months.</p>

<p>The Army required 35,000 complete sketching outfits for the use
of military observers. The contents of these outfits were manufactured
by a dozen different concerns.</p>

<p>Drawing instrument sets were produced by the Eugene Dietzgen
Co. Each set included a pair of proportional dividers. Our draftsmen
had always obtained their dividers from Europe. The divider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
which nearly everyone has seen, appears to be a simple device, yet
it must be made with the utmost precision, or else it is valueless.
In manufacture it goes through more than 100 distinct factory operations.</p>

<p>Marching compasses for troops were made by the Sperry Gyroscope
Co., of Brooklyn, N. Y., the quantity in manufacture being
over 200,000 instruments.</p>

<p>Many other delicate instruments of most difficult manufacture,
whose description is too technical to be set down here, were produced
successfully in America during the war period.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

SOUND AND FLASH RANGING AND SEARCHLIGHTS.</h3>


<p>In childhood we were enthralled by the tales of those magic persons
whose keen hearing could detect even the whisper of the growing
grass. As camouflage developed, modern warfare yearned for such
supernatural gifts of sense that troops might detect the unseen
presence of the enemy. Accordingly Science, the fairy godmother
of today's soldiers, raised her wand, and lo, the Army was equipped
with the wonderful ears of the fairy tale, uncanny no longer, but a
concrete manufacturing proposition.</p>

<p>Artillery practice nowadays abhors the wasted shot. The time
when cannon fired in the general direction of the enemy, and hoped
to hit something, passed when the long-range rifles and howitzers,
with their marvelously accurate sighting instruments, came into
existence. Whole books have been written on the subject of pointing
a modern cannon in the modern way. A great proportion of
our industrial effort in the recent conflict was devoted to the sole
end that we might aim our artillery accurately.</p>

<p>For instance, to this end almost exclusively was devoted the
enormous production of aircraft material. The observer in the
airplane or balloon trusted not to his eyes but to the finer sight
of the photographic camera; and this again occasioned a large war
industry&mdash;the production of cameras and their operation in the
field, which included the production of finished photography in the
field dark rooms. But, as the airplane and aerial camera were
perfected, camouflage was undertaken as a protection from discovery
from aloft; and so might be brought in another chapter&mdash;the
production of camouflage material and the work of camouflage
experts in the field. Presently camouflage succeeded in baffling the
camera to a great extent, and this made necessary the development
of instruments that could detect the location of the enemy by sound.
Since the unaided ear was not keen enough to supply the desired
information, applied science came to the rescue with the various
devices embraced in the general classification of sound-ranging
equipment. The production of this equipment was under the
direction of the Engineer Department of the Army.</p>

<p>In three classes of military work we needed hearing refined to the
razor-edge. With keen enough ears we could detect those subterranean
operations of the enemy known as mining; with ears of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
that sort we could detect and locate the positions of hostile cannon;
and still again we could employ such sensitiveness of hearing to find
in the darkest sky at night the hostile raiding airplane.</p>

<p>One of these long-distance ear drums which man invented for
himself as an aid to his military operations was known as the geophone.
The first geophone used by the western powers in the war was
invented by the French. It was a simple mechanism. The device
or drum which received the sound waves and magnified them consisted
of a small closed box with a confined air space. This box
was weighted with a leaden disk to give it the required inertia.
The geophone was placed upon the ground and the vibrations of
the earth were communicated through the medium of the confined
air space. The sounds then reached the listener's ears via a rubber
tube and an ordinary stethoscope horn. By means of this device
the slightest vibrations of the ground were rendered audible.</p>

<p>The geophone was used to detect enemy mining operations. The
listener placed the weighted box on the floor of an underground
gallery or on solid earth or rock. If the enemy were burrowing in
the ground anywhere within a distance of 75 yards the geophone
would tell about it. In order to enable the listener to know in what
direction the sounds came, two geophone boxes were provided, one
connected with each ear. By placing the boxes a small distance
apart from each other and them moving them until the vibrations
in both ear horns were equalized, the listener could tell approximately
in what direction the enemy mining operation was located.</p>

<p>Geophones were used by both sides, and so effective did they prove
to be that it is reported that they were largely instrumental in
stopping mining operations altogether. If an enemy mine were
located by one of these devices, a counter mine could be started at
once and carried through, usually with disastrous results to the
hostile miners.</p>

<p>As our first step in the production of geophones, we adopted the
French device; but later on we developed an instrument with nearly
one-third greater range than the French geophone had. This improvement
was developed by the Engineers and bureau specialists at
the Bureau of Standards in Washington with money provided by the
Engineering Department. We produced the improved model in
sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the American Expeditionary
Forces.</p>

<p>We also developed an electromechanical geophone that could be
connected up by wire to a central listening station some distance
back from an exposed location. The sound-receiving boxes or
microphones were placed out in No Man's Land and hidden under
trash or earth. They were so sensitive that they would not only
record any subterranean activities of the enemy within their range,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
but at night would betray enemy raiding parties attempting to cross
to our positions, the sensitive boxes picking up the vibrations of their
speech or footsteps. The central listener could locate approximately
the position of hostile operations by observing which boxes were
receiving the sounds in greatest intensity. The boxes could also
pick up and send to the central listening stations conversations carried
on by the enemy parties even in low tones, the apparatus thus acting
as the dictatorship of the war.</p>

<p>But by far the most important work done by listening instruments
was in locating the positions of enemy gun batteries. This was one
scientific instrument, at any rate, which the Germans were never able
to produce successfully for themselves. During the final months of
the war more enemy guns were located by listening instruments
than by any other means. An American instrument with the
Army spotted 117 German gun positions in a single day by surface
sound ranging. This was the high American record set in the war,
but at all times our sound-detecting equipment had an uncanny
accuracy. Up to the end of the fighting, no way had been discovered
to conceal the location of a gun from sound-ranging instruments
suitably placed and properly operated.</p>

<p>The instruments used for locating gun positions were of such a
highly complicated and technical nature that no one but designers
and mechanics skilled in the production of complex electrical equipment
could build them at all. The recording instruments, or microphones,
were of a sort so delicate that their use theretofore had never
been considered outside of laboratories. Yet they were required to
operate successfully amid the din and concussion of heavy bombardments.
All useless sounds and jars were filtered out so that only the
sought-for vibrations could come to the central recording mechanism.</p>

<p>Studies of gunfire showed that when a cannon fires an explosive
shell of high velocity there are three distinct concussions. One of
these is the sharp crack produced in the air when the shell, dragging
a short vacuum trail behind it, passes over the head of the observer.
As the air rushes into this vacuum and collides with itself, it produces
a crack that is similar in origin to ordinary thunder. The second
concussion to be heard is that produced at the muzzle of the gun by
the expanding gases that propel the shell. There is still a third, the
break, or explosion. In order to locate a battery or gun exactly only
one of these concussions&mdash;the explosion at the muzzle of the gun&mdash;must
be picked up by the microphone. The first and third shocks,
and all other sounds not useful to the work should be damped out and
excluded.</p>

<p>A number of these microphones would be placed in scattered positions,
usually in a trench, and then connected with the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
recording mechanism. When a microphone picked up a hostile gun
explosion the disturbance was instantly transmitted through several
miles of wire. An ingenious and complicated mechanism actuated
an electromagnetic needle, which instantly recorded this disturbance
on a tape of photographic paper, calibrated to show fifths of seconds
in time. Each microphone on outpost duty was represented on this
tape by a parallel line; and, as six microphones were usually used, the
tape was striped with six parallel lines. As the other microphones at
the front picked up the concussion of the gun, their records were made
on their respective lines; and the observers at the central station, by
noting the difference in time between the reports of the various
microphones, and by making calculations based on the rate at which
sound travels, could locate the gun that set up the disturbances by
means of ordinary surveyor's triangulations. So accurately would
this mechanism do the work that a gun position could be determined
within 50 or 60 feet.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the practice of our Army
was to secure in advance, by means of surface sound ranging and
other methods, the positions of all the enemy's guns that could be
learned. Then, often after intervals of hours or even days, the fire
began simultaneously upon all these gun positions just as our attack
started.</p>

<p>In this country we had two experimental stations for the development
of sound-ranging apparatus. We began experiments in this
work in June, 1917. Before we had perfected any satisfactory
instruments, the British had met with great success with the Bull-Tucker
system; and we adopted that type for the use of the American
Expeditionary Forces. From plans and models sent to this country
we produced an American Bull-Tucker machine, utilizing standard
American electrical equipment wherever we could. At the close of
the war we had in operation along the American front 12 complete
American outfits. The six microphones of each recording machine
in action were set about 5,000 feet apart along the front, so that each
sound-ranging section covered a frontage of approximately 5 miles.
The 12 outfits in use were sufficient to locate the guns of the enemy
on a 60-mile front.</p>

<p>About a month before the fighting stopped we sent to France a
new model sound-ranging set which had been developed with the
cooperation of the Bureau of Standards. The reports from the
American Expeditionary Forces indicated that this American development
was superior in several important particulars to anything else
in use when the war came to an end. The American instruments were
lighter, easier to carry about, easier to install, and much cheaper than
those of the British type, and would operate under more adverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
weather conditions. The impulses received by the microphone in this
equipment were recorded on a running tape smoked by an acetylene
flame.</p>

<p>Sound ranging for the detection of airplanes at night requires an
equipment which consists fundamentally of a sound-gathering device
and a listening mechanism, the combination enabling the observer to
tell the direction from which the sound is coming. When a bombing
plane approaches at night the hum of the motor can be heard at a
distance from 1 to 3 miles, or even more, depending upon conditions.
But the direction of this sound is elusive to the unaided ear, as anyone
can testify who has heard an airplane in broad daylight but could
not locate it with his eyes. Before the invention of aerial sound
ranging the searchlights hunting for the hostile airplane were
obliged to sweep the sky aimlessly in an endeavor to locate it; and
the pilot of the plane could often maneuver to keep out of the light.
But by use of the sound detectors not only can the approach of the
airplane be detected at a distance beyond the hearing range of the
unaided ear, but, what is more important, its direction can be determined
within an angle of 3&deg;. The use of these sound detectors greatly
increased the chances of locating airplanes at night by searchlight.</p>

<p>The Engineer Department conducted extensive experiments in the
development of aerial sound detectors. One form developed consisted
of a set of long horns with listening tubes attached to the
small ends and leading to receivers on the observer's head set. These
horns were mounted on a turntable which the observer could revolve,
so that the horns could be turned in the general direction of the
sound. Four horns were used in this mechanism&mdash;two to indicate
the direction of the airplane on a horizontal circle (in azimuth), and
the other pair to indicate the direction on the vertical arc (in elevation).
Under favorable conditions the sensitiveness of this device
was three times that of the unaided ear, and the airplane could be
located within an angle of 1&deg;. The horn detector, however, was
large and cumbersome and not satisfactory for a mobile unit.</p>

<p>For field sound ranging, when the listener may wish to move from
place to place, the parabloid sound reflector was developed. This
hemispherical object, like a huge fountain basin in shape, was made of
material similar to building board and shaped in parabolic lines.
Such a sound collector echoed or reflected the sound from every
point of its surface to a focal point where the listening instrument
was located. The observer turned the parabloid on its universal
mount until the sound was equalized in his ears, and then the
exact direction of the airplane would be indicated by the azimuth
and elevation pointers on the machine. The paraboloids developed
by our Engineering Department had a sensitiveness three times that
of the unaided ear and could locate sound within 3&deg; of arc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>We were not pioneers in developing the parabloid, however, the
French having built them ahead of us; but our apparatus possessed
marked advantages over that of the French. In the first place, the
French collecting device weighed 3&frac12; tons and was so heavy and cumbersome
that it could scarcely be moved at all. The total weight of the
American collecting device was only 1,300 pounds. The American
instrument was thus much lighter and more portable. It was so
simple that it could be set up in about one-sixth the time that it took
to erect the French device. The cost of our machine was only about
two-fifths that of the French mechanism.</p>

<p>Although valuable work in detecting gun positions was done by
sound ranging, yet both sides located guns by watching their flashes.
We improved flash-ranging sets of the allies. These were simple in
principle. A number of observers at posts commanding good views
were equipped with observation telescopes mounted on tripods to
watch for the flashes of enemy guns. Whenever two or more of them
observed the same flash and reported its direction, the position of the
gun could be determined by ordinary triangulation.</p>

<p>However, in operation the system was not so simple, because of
the fact that the observers reporting might not have turned their
instruments upon the same flash. This difficulty was met by furnishing
each observer with an outpost switch set. As soon as he
observed the flash through his telescope he closed the switch, and
that action turned on a small electric light at the headquarters
station, which might be miles away. Then, as soon as he could, he
telephoned in the direction of the flash observed. If the operator
at the switchboard saw two or three of the lights flash simultaneously,
he knew the observers at the front had probably caught the same
flash. Lights that came on a little ahead or a little behind the
simultaneous lights were disregarded when the observers telephoned
reports.</p>

<p>In developing the telescope for this system considerable difficulty
was experienced on account of the shortage of the proper optical
glass in this country. We were, therefore, obliged to buy our
telescopes in France until our supply would be available. These
telescopes were expensive mechanisms, and in some of the work
of the flash-ranging sections two of them were originally required
at each observing station&mdash;one to determine the position of a shell
burst in elevation and the other its position on the horizontal circle
in azimuth. Since the declaration of the armistice an American
Engineer officer has designed a telescope eyepiece which enables
this work to be done by observing through a single instrument,
thus effecting a marked saving in the number of telescopes which
might be required in the future.</p>

<p>When the fighting stopped our military scientists and others
cooperating with them were developing a type of ground sound-ranging
apparatus which it was hoped could be utilized to give troops
warning of the firing of heavy artillery shells in their general direction.
Preliminary experiments show that at a distance of 4.1 miles this
mechanism could record the firing of a gun some 19 seconds before
the arrival of the shell. Under proper circumstances this elapsed
time would enable troops properly warned to seek cover from the
explosion of the projectile. This development of sound-ranging apparatus
and its application to the protection of personnel was made
possible by the far greater speed with which shock vibrations travel
through a dense medium like the earth than through the usual
sound-conveying medium, the atmosphere.</p>


<h4>SEARCHLIGHTS.</h4>

<p>The searchlight equipment of the United States Army prior to
1914 consisted chiefly of lights located at our coast defenses. In
1916 we began the development of mobile searchlight-and-power
units for field-army work, four horse-drawn equipments, with 36-inch
lights, being ordered first, and later eight other sets, with extensible
towers and gasoline electric generators. When the war was approaching
we ordered 85 sets of the limber-and-caisson type. The caissons
of these sets carried 24-inch lights on extensible towers. In January,
1917, we ordered 50 high-intensity lights to replace as many low-intensity
lamps at our seacoast fortifications. The first war order
was placed in April, 1917, and consisted of 20 additional searchlights
of the 60-inch dimension, the largest light ordered by the War
Department.</p>

<p>After the entrance of America in the war the Engineer Department
began studying the requirements abroad for searchlights used in
defense against hostile aircraft; and in September, 1917, this investigation
resulted in orders for 360 high-intensity searchlights, 693
high-intensity arc mechanisms, and 1,000 glass mirrors of standard
design.</p>

<p>About this time we began looking to the improvement of existing
searchlight equipment. The cooperation of leading scientists,
manufacturers, and Government bureaus was obtained, and the
product of exhaustive experiments was 18 different new kinds of
searchlights either partially or wholly developed.</p>

<p>The first of these were produced, shipped, and were in operation
with the Second Field Army in France on October 1, 1918. This
was a new form of searchlight more powerful than any that had been
produced before that time. It weighed one-eighth as much as lights
of former design, cost only one-third as much, was about one-fourth
as large in bulk, and threw a light 10 per cent stronger than any
other portable projector in existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>Without going into the details of this mechanism its most striking
innovation, from the standpoint of the nontechnical observer, was
the absence of the front glass through which the beams of the older
type lamps are sent. The absence of the glass, while reducing the
weight and cost of a light, also increased the intensity of the beam
of the searchlight, since any glass, no matter how conducive to rays,
absorbs light to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>In the first part of the war we took the 36-inch lights which the
Government had on hand and mounted them on motor trucks. For
generating power for the lights, motor trucks were equipped with
electric generators operated by the crank-shaft of the truck engine.
In moving about each truck carried not only the light and power
unit and accessories, but provided space for the crew and their
equipment.</p>

<p>When we went into the war there was only one firm in the United
States that could make the large searchlight mirrors, but two other
concerns developed the art and the faculties during the hostilities.
These mirrors were of glass and cost about $1,000 at prewar prices.
The maximum output in the United States before the war was three
60-inch mirrors per week. As the result of governmental encouragement
the production of the 60-inch mirrors increased until it reached
the stage of 15 a week in November, 1918; and the price was reduced
to about $900 per mirror, even under war-time conditions with respect
to labor and material. This was equivalent to a price of about
$700 per mirror under normal conditions, or a saving of 30 per cent.</p>

<p>A remarkable contribution of the United States to searchlight
science was the production of a satisfactory metal mirror for projecting
the beam. The metal mirror not only weighed a little less than
the glass mirror, but it cost only one-third as much as the glass one,
could be produced in one-fifth the time, was much less fragile, and
extended the possibility of manufacture to a wide number of industries.
The metal mirror possessed 97 per cent of the reflectivity of
the glass mirror. This slight dullness is inappreciable in searchlight
work and more than compensated for by the other qualities of the
metal reflector. This type of mirror, however, had not yet been
put in production when the war ended.</p>

<p>Our inventors during the 19 months of hostilities succeeded in
reducing the size of carbons used in 200-ampere lamps from 2 inches
in diameter to 1&#x215B; inches. This cut the cost of carbons in two, but
the improvements tripled the amount of light developed.</p>

<p>In November, 1918, we were working with assurance of success to
develop a simple system whereby field searchlights could be pointed
and controlled from a distance. Such controls had been used in
experimental work prior to 1917, but the mechanisms were complicated
and not suitable for field service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>The searchlight section of the Corps of Engineers also developed
optical finding devices, which doubled the range of all searchlights
without requiring any modification of the lights themselves. Neither
the ordinary telescope nor night glass is suitable for target finding
by searchlight. The result of our investigation was the development
of a combined observer's chair, eye protector, and searchlight target
finder, the new equipment adding only 10 per cent to the cost of the
searchlight unit.</p>

<p>The range of our modern high-power searchlight, whose target is
a ship at sea, is about 15,000 yards; the range of this searchlight when
its target is an airplane is about 15,000 feet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

TOXIC GASES.</h3>


<p>The first recorded use of suffocating gases in warfare was about
431 B. C., sulphur fumes having been used in besieging the cities of
Platea and Belium in the war between the Athenians and the Spartans.
Similar uses of toxic substances are recorded during the Middle Ages.
In August, 1855, the English Admiral Lord Dundonald, having observed
the deadly character of the fumes of sulphur in Sicily, proposed
to reduce Sebastopol by sulphur fumes, and worked out the details of
the proposition. The English Government disapproved the proposition
on the ground that "the effects were so horrible that no honorable
combatant could use the means required to produce them."</p>

<p>That the probable use of poison gases was still in the minds of
military men is evidenced by the fact that at The Hague conference
in 1899 several of the more prominent nations of Europe and Asia
pledged themselves not to use any projectiles whose only object was
to give out suffocating or poisonous gases. Many of the Powers
did not sign this declaration until later. Germany signed and ratified
it on September 4, 1900, but the United States never signed it.
Further, this declaration was not to be binding in case of a war in
which a non-signatory was or became a belligerent. Admiral Mahan,
a United States delegate, stated his position in regard to the use of
gas in shell, at that time an untried theory, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reproach of cruelty and perfidy addressed against these supposed shells was
equally uttered previously against firearms and torpedoes, although both are now
employed without scruple. It is illogical and not demonstrably humane to be tender
about asphyxiating men with gas, when all are prepared to admit that it is allowable
to blow the bottom out of an ironclad at midnight, throwing four or five hundred
men into the sea to be choked by the water, with scarcely the remotest chance to
escape.</p></div>

<p>The Second Hague Peace Congress in 1907 adopted rules for land
warfare, and among them was article 23 which read as follows: "It
is expressly forbidden to employ poisons or poisonous weapons."</p>

<p>The use of toxic gas in the great war dates back to April 22, 1915,
on which day the Germans employed chlorine, a common and well-known
gas, in an attack against the French and British lines in the
northeastern part of the upper Ypres salient.</p>

<p>The methods of manufacturing toxic gases, the use of such gases,
and the tactics connected with their use were new developments of this
war; yet during the year 1918 from 20 to 30 per cent of all American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
battle casualties were due to gas, showing that toxic gas is one of the
most powerful implements of war. The records show, however, that
when armies were supplied with masks and other defensive appliances,
only about 3 or 4 per cent of the gas casualties were fatal.
This indicates that gas can be made not only one of the most effective
implements of war, but one of the most humane. It will, of course,
be necessary to remove the noncombatant population from a greater
depth of country immediately in the rear of the fighting lines than
formerly, in order that women and children may not be gassed.
This additional sacrifice of territory for war uses is another element
of effectiveness in the weapon.</p>

<p>Since Germany had chosen to utilize toxic gas in warfare, the
allied nations were compelled to adopt like tactics; accordingly
England and France, faced with the desperate situation resulting
from advantages secured by the Germans through the employment
of these new weapons, immediately turned their attention not only
to devising methods for protecting their own troops, but also to
securing supplies and equipment necessary for the utilization of
toxic gas as an agent of warfare against the German Army.</p>

<p>Germany originated thereafter the use of most of the new forms
of gas, but the allied nations and America were actually producing,
at the time of the armistice, gases on a much greater scale than Germany
was ever able to attain. In fact, America itself was producing
gases at a rate several times as great as was possible in Germany.</p>

<p>Prior to the entry of America in the war our overseas observers had
been collecting information bearing upon gas warfare, referring the
facts so obtained to the Ordnance Department in Washington, where
the information was turned over to Lieut. Col. E. J. W. Ragsdale,
who was then in charge of the Trench Warfare Section.</p>

<p>In the early days of our belligerency it was seen that we should
need a plant for filling artillery shell with toxic gases. The Government
in the fall of 1917 bought a large tract of land near Aberdeen,
Md., to be an artillery proving ground. Approximately 3,400 acres
of this reservation, about one-tenth of it in area, was set aside as the
site for the gas shell-filling plant. This reservation was known as
Edgewood, and the plant erected on the site was called the Edgewood
Arsenal. Work started on the construction of the arsenal on November
1, 1917.</p>

<p>None of the toxic gases in use in Europe, except chlorine and small
amounts of phosgene, had ever been commercially prepared in the
United States. It was the original intention to interest existing
chemical firms in the manufacture of these gases; but there were
many difficulties in the way of such a project, not the least of which
was the ruling of the Director General of Railways that such products
as poison gas be transported only on special trains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Also we discovered that the private chemical companies were loath
to undertake such manufacture. The exhaustive investigations necessary
before quantity methods of manufacture could be devised would
be uncertain and expensive. There would be great danger to the
lives of those employed in such work. Many of the private concerns
were already crowded with war work. Finally, the new plant equipment
which must be set up would be worth nothing when the war
ended, since the manufacture of such gases would be limited to the
period of hostilities. These and other considerations explain the
reluctance of the commercial chemical industry to undertake the
production of war gases.</p>

<p>Consequently the Government was forced to adopt the plan of
building various chemical plants at the Edgewood Arsenal in connection
with the filling plant. By December 1, 1917, it had been
decided to build at Edgewood a chlorpicrin plant and a phosgene plant.
The contracts were immediately let, and the work was pushed through
the rigorous winter of 1917-18.</p>

<p>In March, 1918, the Edgewood project was taken from the Trench
Warfare Section of the Ordnance Department and made an independent
division under the command of Col. Wm. H. Walker. In
June, 1918, the Chemical Warfare Service was organized, and the
Edgewood Arsenal was transferred to it. Gen. W. L. Sibert, Director
of the Gas Service, took charge of the activities of the arsenal in May
prior to the official transfer.</p>

<p>Chlorine, the raw material for the manufacture of which is common
salt, was one of the principal materials required in the gas-production
program. Although chlorine was a standard product in the United
States prior to the war, it was soon seen that we had an inadequate
commercial supply to meet the requirements of our proposed gas
offensive. Chlorine was used not only by itself, but it was also the
active agent in the manufacture of nearly all the other toxic gases
which we required. Consequently we decided to build a Government
chlorine plant with two 50-ton units, giving a daily capacity of 100
tons of liquid chlorine. The ground for this plant at Edgewood was
broken on May 11, 1918, and the actual production of chlorine begun
on September 1.</p>

<p>In July, 1917, the Germans introduced the so-called mustard gas.
It was immediately realized that for certain purposes of fighting this
chemical was the most effective product so far employed, and a large
number of Government experts here at once concentrated their energies
in developing methods for its manufacture on a large scale. Not only
were the uniformed experimenters busy at the Gas Service's American
University Camp, at Washington, D. C., but experimental units were
established at the plant of the Dow Chemical Co., at Midland, Mich., at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the plant of Zinsser &amp; Co., Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y., and at the
Government plant which had been started by the Trench Warfare
Section, at Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>Eventually it was decided to erect a large plant at Edgewood for the
manufacture of mustard gas. Not until April, 1918, however, did
we feel that we possessed sufficient knowledge and information to
justify the construction of a mustard-gas plant on a large scale.
France and England also were long in working out satisfactory
methods of mustard-gas production. We began to make mustard
in June, and continued with rapidly increasing output until the
signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>It soon became evident that we could not depend upon civilian
labor in the operation of the various chemical plants at Edgewood
because of the danger involved. It was decided, therefore, to utilize
enlisted men in the working crews. As the projects at Edgewood
increased in size and number, the forces at the arsenal grew, until at
one time there were 7,400 troops at this point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Government had at last been able to persuade a
number of private chemical firms to manufacture toxic gases. The
Government agreed to finance all new construction, but the operation
was to be in the hands of the contracting companies. At each
plant the Government stationed one of its representatives with necessary
assistants. In the spring of 1918, these scattered factories by
official order were made part of the Edgewood Arsenal, each plant
being designated by the name of the city or town where it was located.
Thereafter in Army usage the term "Edgewood Arsenal" embraced
not only the group of factories on the Edgewood reservation, but also
included the following projects:</p>

<p>Niagara Falls plant, operated by the Oldbury Electro-Chemical
Co. Project&mdash;the manufacture of phosgene.</p>

<p>Midland, Mich., plant, operated by the Dow Chemical Co. Project&mdash;the
sinking of 17 brine wells for the purpose of securing adequate
supplies of bromine.</p>

<p>Charleston, W. Va., plant, operated by the Charleston Chemical
Co. Project&mdash;the manufacture of sulphur chloride.</p>

<p>Bound Brook, N. J., plant, operated by Frank Hemingway (Inc.).
Project&mdash;the manufacture of phosgene.</p>

<p>Buffalo plant, operated by the National Aniline &amp; Chemical Co.
Project&mdash;the manufacture of mustard gas.</p>

<p>In addition to these, the Edgewood Arsenal built at points advantageous
to supplies of raw materials four other plants, and operated

<p>In constructing and equipping the Edgewood Arsenal we laid 21
miles of standard-gauge railway and 15 miles of narrow-gauge railway,
built nearly 15 miles of improved roadway, and set up two water systems,
one with a capacity of 1,500,000 gallons per day for the manufacturing
purposes of the chemical plants, and the other providing a
fresh-water supply pumped 4 miles with a daily capacity of 2,000,000
gallons. In all 558 buildings were put up on the grounds of the arsenal.
There were 86 cantonment buildings, with a capacity of 8,400 men,
as well as adequate quarters for officers and civilian employees.
Three field hospitals, a complete base hospital, and separate buildings
for Y. M. C. A. and K. of C. activities indicated the extent of the
building equipment. Three power houses were provided, with a
total capacity of 26,500 kilowatts.</p>

<p>In the construction of buildings every precaution was taken to
avoid accidents from the handling of toxic gas, the ventilating systems
being as near perfection as human science could make them.
It is notable that out of the thousands of men employed only four
met their death by gas poisoning. Three of these casualties were due
to phosgene and one to mustard gas.</p>

<p>To show that all of the danger of the war was not confined to the
front, the following table of casualties in 1918 at the Edgewood
Arsenal proper is here given:</p>

<p>As has been noted, chlorine was the only war gas produced on a
commercial scale in America prior to the war. At the ordinary temperatures
chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas of strong, suffocating odor.
Through the combined effects of cold and pressure it is readily condensed
to a liquid and is ordinarily shipped in this form, stored in
strong cylinders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>Chlorine is prepared commercially by the electrolytic process. A
current of electricity is passed through a solution of common salt.
The greenish gas at once arises, leaving behind it a residue of caustic
soda. The apparatus in which the salt is decomposed by the electric
current is known as a cell. The Government plant used Nelson cells,
each with a capacity of 60 pounds of chlorine and 65 pounds of caustic
soda per 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Government chlorine plant at Edgewood was ready for operation
in August, 1918, but was not actually started until September 1.
The plant consisted of (1) a cell house, which had a total capacity
of 100 tons of chlorine per 24 hours; (2) an electric substation for
supplying the current; (3) a brine building, where the salt was
mixed with water and the resulting brine purified; (4) a boiler and
evaporation building, for concentrating the caustic soda from the
cells; (5) a caustic fusion building, for drying the caustic soda and
fusing it into solid form for shipment; and (6) a liquefying plant to
condense and liquefy 50 tons of chlorine per day.</p>

<p>With the exception of chlorine, chlorpicrin was the first war gas
to be manufactured on a large scale in this country. When pure,
chlorpicrin is a colorless liquid which boils at a temperature approximately
of 112&deg; C. The compound has been known since 1848.
While not so poisonous as some of the other products used in gas warfare,
it is, nevertheless, an active poison, and has the additional
advantage of being a fair lachrymator, or tear producer.</p>

<p>Chlorpicrin is made by the reaction between picric acid and chlorine.
The chlorine is best supplied in the form of so-called bleaching
powder, which is ordinary chloride of lime. In the manufacturing
process as originally carried out, free picric acid was mixed with
bleaching powder held in suspension with water. Later it was found
advantageous to use calcium picrate instead of picric acid.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the final process was as follows: The bleaching powder
was creamed with water and mixed with a solution of calcium picrate
in large stills holding 5,000 gallons or more. A jet of live steam was
then introduced at the bottom of the still, and the reaction began at
once, the rapidity depending upon the amount of steam introduced.
The resulting chlorpicrin, together with a certain quantity of steam,
passed out of the still and was liquefied in the condenser. The resulting
mixture of chlorpicrin and water was run into tanks, where the
chlorpicrin, being insoluble in water, gradually settled to the bottom
and was run off and used directly in gas shell.</p>

<p>In developing this process the Government was assisted by the
Dow Chemical Co., the Semet-Solvay Co., and the American Synthetic
Color Co., of Stamford, Conn., the principal work being done
by representatives of the Bureau of Mines at the Stamford plant.</p>

America's whole supply of chlorpicrin during the war came from the
American Synthetic Color Co. and the Edgewood Arsenal. The
Stamford plant was the first to reach large-scale production.</p>

<p>The contract with the American Synthetic Color Co. was dated
December 13, 1917; and the company shipped over 111,853 pounds
of the gas to Edgewood on March 11. This, when mixed with the
necessary stannic chloride, supplies of which were already on the
ground, was sufficient to fill approximately 100,000 75-millimeter
shell. In the spring of 1918, due to certain internal troubles at the
Stamford plant, it was agreed that the United States should lease
this factory and operate it as a Government plant. Under Government
operation the total production of chlorpicrin at the Stamford
plant amounted to 3,226,000 pounds, of which 2,703,300 pounds
were shipped overseas in 660-pound drums.</p>

<p>The chlorpicrin plant at Edgewood went into entire operation on
June 14, 1918. Up to the signing of the armistice this plant had
produced 2,320,000 pounds of chlorpicrin.</p>

<p>Phosgene was one of the deadliest gases employed in the war.
Numerous other gases were used to annoy the enemy and force the
wearing of masks, but phosgene was a killer employed to produce as
many casualties as possible. The gas did not persist long in the air
or on the ground after the shell had exploded, so that it was an ideal
chemical for use in an attack. The gas would clear away by the
time the troops following reached the place of gas concentration.</p>

<p>Phosgene at ordinary temperatures is a colorless gas, but it condenses
to a liquid at 8&deg; C. It is formed by the combination of two
gases, chlorine and carbon monoxide, in the presence of a catalyzer.
The reaction is best conducted in iron boxes lined with lead and
filled with charcoal of proper quality, into which boxes a stream of
the reacting gases, mixed in proper proportions, is introduced. The
reaction creates heat, and means must usually be taken to keep the
reaction boxes cooled. The resulting phosgene is condensed to a
liquid by passing the gas through a condenser which is surrounded
by brine kept cold by refrigeration. The liquid is then stored in
strong steel containers or run directly into Livens drums or artillery
shell.</p>

<p>Prior to 1917, the Oldbury Electro-Chemical Co., of Niagara
Falls, N. Y., had set up a small experimental phosgene plant in the
hope that the experiments might lead to the commercial utilization
of carbon monoxide which was obtained by this company as a by-product
in the manufacture of phosphorus. When we entered
the war the company had developed its process to such efficiency
as to warrant the construction of a large phosgene plant, and the
Government entered into a contract with the company for the
creation of facilities with a capacity of 10 tons of phosgene per day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Also, because of the great importance of phosgene in warfare, it
was decided at the same time to build a Government phosgene plant
at Edgewood. A little later the Government financed a phosgene
plant at the factory of Frank Hemingway (Inc.), at Bound
Brook, N. J.</p>

<p>The total output of the original small experimental plant at
Niagara Falls, which was later leased by the United States, was
83,070 pounds of phosgene, of which 24,800 pounds were shipped
overseas. The contract with the Oldbury Chemical Co. for its
main phosgene plant was signed on January 15, 1918. Production
here began on August 5 and by August 20 had reached a daily
average of 5 tons. On November 1 the average daily production
was 7 tons. The total quantity produced at this plant was 435
tons. The plant loaded 18,768 Livens drums with phosgene, each
drum holding about 30 pounds. This plant was operated by enlisted
men.</p>

<p>The contract with Frank Hemingway (Inc.) called for a factory
producing 5 tons of phosgene per day by a secret process controlled
by the company. The construction of the plant was begun on
February 2, 1918, and phosgene was first manufactured on May 17.
This concern reached its maximum of 5 tons per day by August 1,
and produced in all 205 tons of phosgene.</p>

<p>Construction of the phosgene plant at Edgewood was begun on
March 1, 1918. The plant consisted of four catalyzer buildings,
each building having four units, each unit possessing a projected
capacity of 5 tons of phosgene per day. The total capacity, therefore,
was designed to be 80 tons per day. The carbon monoxide
used in the process was produced by passing a mixture of oxygen
and carbon dioxide over heated coke in a gas producer, the oxygen
being supplied by a Claude machine with a capacity of 100,000
cubic feet of oxygen every 24 hours. The chlorine used came partly
from the Edgewood chlorine plant and partly from outside sources.</p>

<p>The actual production of phosgene at Edgewood began on July 5,
1918, and worked up to an output of 20 tons per day by the date of
the armistice. The total production of phosgene at Edgewood was
935 tons. The total output of phosgene from all three plants,
Edgewood and the Bound Brook and Niagara Falls operations, at
the date of the armistice was 35 tons per day; and this was increasing
to reach 95 tons per day by May 1, 1919. The total phosgene
produced by all the plants before the armistice was 1,616 tons.</p>

<p>The Germans, in spite of their attainments in chemistry, were
never able to improve their clumsy and expensive methods of producing
mustard gas. The best reports we have show that at the
time the fighting ended, all of Germany's chemical warfare facilities
could not produce more than 6 tons of mustard per day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
United States alone had ten times that capacity on the same date,
while France and England both reached a heavy output. So concerned
was the German high command because of the fact that
Germany was being outdistanced in the production of mustard gas
that the ablest spy of the German Empire was sent into France in
October, 1918, to find out the French method of making mustard.
One of the Chemical Warfare officers who accompanied our forces
into German territory reported that the Germans had decided to
adopt the American method of making mustard gas and to stop
their former process.</p>

<p>Mustard gas was by no means a child of the great war, having been
prepared in experimental quantities since 1886. It is a colorless,
slightly oily liquid, boiling at 220&deg; C. with some decomposition.
When perfectly pure it freezes at 14&deg; C.; but, since it usually contains
small percentages of impurities, it usually remains liquid at 0&deg; C, or
even below that. In chemistry the substance is known as dichlorethyl
sulphide.</p>

<p>The first commercial process proposed for the manufacture of mustard
gas depended upon the use of ethylene chlorhydrin; and on
April 13, 1918, a contract was made with the Commercial Research
Co., Flushing, Long Island, for the manufacture of 10 tons per day
by this process. In the spring and summer of 1918 a new process
was developed both abroad and in the United States, one which used
sulphur monochloride. Accordingly, the contract with the Commercial
Research Co. was canceled, and efforts were concentrated on the
later process.</p>

<p>This process consisted in blowing gaseous ethylene into liquid sulphur
monochloride in large iron reaction vessels. The reaction developed
much heat. Sulphur is set free by this reaction, and the
temperature must be controlled in order to prevent the formation of
solid sulphur in the reaction machine.</p>

<p>At the date of the armistice three mustard gas plants were either
completed or nearing completion. The construction of the Edgewood
plant was begun on May 18, 1918, and the first mustard was
produced exactly a month later. The changing of processes, however,
hampered production somewhat, but by September 20, the arsenal
was producing 10 tons per day, and by November 11 had increased
this to 30 tons per day. The total production of mustard gas at
Edgewood during the war period was 711 tons, of which approximately
300 tons went into shell.</p>

<p>On July 8, 1918, the Government began the construction of a
mustard gas plant at Hastings, N. Y. This factory was to have a
capacity of 25 tons per day, afterwards increased to 50 tons per day.
The first unit of this plant was ready to operate when the armistice
was signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>On July 6, 1918, the Government signed a contract with the
National Aniline &amp; Chemical Co., Buffalo, N. Y., calling for a mustard
gas plant with a capacity of 50 tons daily. On November 11 this
plant was 80 per cent complete. The cost of the plant was met by
the Government, but the operation was to be in the hands of the
Buffalo concern. The total daily capacity of all three plants when
complete was estimated to be 200 tons.</p>

<p>To insure an adequate supply of sulphur monochloride for its mustard
gas production the Government built a special plant at Edgewood
with a capacity of 300 tons of sulphur monochloride per day.</p>

<p>As soon as toxic gas warfare had developed to a considerable
extent, the perfection of gas-absorbing masks had given almost a
complete protection against this new weapon, if the soldier put
on his gas mask in time. But the mask, especially the earlier
forms of it, was not easy upon the wearer, due to the difficulty of
breathing through it and also because it restricted the soldier's
vision. It was soon discovered that a force compelled to wear its
gas masks for any considerable period lost in efficiency. The employment
of gas by both sides for the purpose of forcing the opposite sides
to wear masks continually was an important element in war at the
close of hostilities.</p>

<p>For this purpose the so-called tear gases were produced. Gassing
the enemy with tear gas was much cheaper than with poison gas,
yet it forced him to remain masked. The tear gases were highly
effective. Even a trace of tear gas in the air would in a few moments
blind a man temporarily. A single tear-gas shell could force the
wearing of masks over an area so wide that it would require from
500 to 1,000 phosgene shell to produce the same effect.</p>

<p>Most of the tear gases had bromine bases; so it was early determined
that we should have to increase the American supply of
bromine considerably if we were to meet our gas-warfare requirements.
Bromine is a deep red liquid which boils at 63&deg; C. The
domestic source of bromine is principally in certain subterranean
brines found in the United States, these solutions containing bromine
in its compounds. The brines obtained in the vicinity of Midland,
Mich., are especially rich in bromine, and by far the largest amount
of bromine obtained in this country comes from that locality.</p>

<p>In December, 1917, at a conference with Mr. Dow, of the Dow Chemical
Co., Midland, Mich., it was decided that the Government should
finance the sinking of 17 brine wells near Midland, the Dow Chemical
Co. to supervise the work and to produce the bromine from the
brine. The work on this project was not begun until March, 1918,
but the entire project was practically completed when the armistice
was signed. This plant is a future war asset of the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
It is capable of yielding approximately 650,000 pounds of bromine
per year.</p>

<p>The tear gas which we prepared to manufacture was brombenzyl
cyanide. It is a brownish oily liquid which solidifies to white or
brownish crystals at 29&deg; C.</p>

<p>The production of brombenzyl cyanide involves a fairly intricate
chemical process. The first step is to chlorinate ordinary toluol, one
of the coal tar bases, to produce benzyl chloride. This chloride is
then mixed with sodium cyanide in alcoholic solution and distilled,
benzyl cyanide being the result. It is then only necessary to brominate
the benzyl cyanide by treating it with bromine vapor.</p>

<p>The first manufacture of brombenzyl cyanide in the United States
was conducted at an experimental plant at the American University
Station at Washington. After this a large scale plant was authorized
at the plant of the Federal Dye &amp; Chemical Co., at Kingsport,
Tenn. The construction of this factory began on July 8, 1918, and
operations started on October 29, the total production of brombenzyl
cyanide being a trifle over 5 tons. In November the plant reached
a capacity of 3 tons per day.</p>

<p>The bromine gases were not poisonous in the sense of being killers,
but were merely highly irritating to the membranes of the eye. The
killing gases were phosgene, chlorpicrin, and chlorine. Mustard gas
in sufficient amount was also fatal, its effect being identical to that
of a deep burn. It attacked the lungs, the eyes, the skin, and even
the intestines if food contaminated with mustard gas were swallowed.
An insidious feature of mustard gas is the fact that its action is
practically always delayed. It might be several hours after a man
was gassed, even fatally, with mustard before he became aware of it,
and then it was too late to administer the treatment that might save
his life. Goggles alone would have been sufficient protection against
tear gas, except for the fact that it was invariably mixed with the
deadlier gases.</p>

<p>The various experiments preliminary to our production of gases
were conducted in provisional laboratories at the Bureau of Standards,
Washington, D. C., Bureau of Mines, Washington, D. C., the
Geophysical Laboratory, Washington, D. C., the Ohio State University,
Columbus, Ohio, and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
Md. A control laboratory for the solution of problems arising in
manufacture was eventually established at Edgewood. A total of
167,092 single chemical determinations were made at these laboratories
under the direction of 20 commissioned officers, 45 noncommissioned
officers, and 204 privates.</p>

<p>The production of gases and other chemicals was only part of the
work of the Edgewood Arsenal and its subsidiary plants. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
chief activity was that of filling artillery shell with the toxic substances.
The description of the plant which filled shell with phosgene
will indicate the scale upon which this operation was conducted.</p>

<p>The empty shell, after being inspected, were loaded on trucks,
together with the proper number of loaded boosters. The booster
was the device which exploded the shell and scattered the gas.
Electric locomotives then pulled the shell trucks to the filling buildings.
There were four of these to a single shell-filling plant, radiating
at right angles from a common center. From the trucks the empty
shell were lifted by hand to a belt conveyor and the conveyor carried
the shell slowly through a room kept cold by artificial refrigeration.
Although the shell moved only 70 feet through this room the conveyor
traveled so slowly that they were 30 minutes in transit, and during
this time they were cooled to a temperature of about 0&deg; F. This
chilling was necessary because phosgene has a low boiling point, and
it was necessary to keep the temperature of the metal of the shell
considerably below the boiling point of phosgene in order that the
gas might remain in liquid form while the filling was going on.</p>

<p>The chilled shell cases were next transferred to small trucks, each
carrying six of them. The loaded truck was then drawn through a
filling tunnel by means of a chain haul. This tunnel was so ingeniously
contrived that the human assistance to the filling and closing
machinery could all be conducted from the outside. The phosgene,
kept liquid by refrigeration, was run into the shell by an automatic filler.</p>

<p>The truck was then moved forward a few feet to a point where the
boosters were inserted into the noses of the shell by the hands of the
operator reaching in through an aperture in the tunnel. The final
closing of the shell was then accomplished by motors. The air in the
filling tunnel was constantly withdrawn by strong ventilation, the
exhaust air being washed in stone towers by chemical agents to
neutralize any gases that might be present. The filled, inclosed shell
were next conveyed to a dump, where they were classified and then
stood nose down for 24 hours to test them for leaks. Then they were
painted, striped, and stenciled by air paint brushes. The final
process was to pack them in boxes and store them for shipment.
This was done in large storage magazines on the grounds of the
Edgewood Arsenal.</p>

<p>A similar method was used for filling shell with chlorpicrin, except
that refrigeration was unnecessary. Mustard gas required another
sort of filling machine.</p>

<p>Several filling plants were designed and constructed for filling
grenades with stannic chloride and with white phosphorus, and also
one for filling incendiary drop bombs.</p>

<p>The capacity of each of these plants per day was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>Stannic chloride plant, hand grenades, 25,000. White phosphorus
grenade plant, 30,000. White phosphorus smoke-shell plant, 155
millimeter shell, 2,000; or 4.7-inch or 5-inch shell, 4,000; or 75-millimeter
shell, 6,000. Incendiary drop-bomb plant, 2,000.</p>

<p>The following sentences summarize the production and expectations
of the Edgewood Arsenal:</p>

<p>(1) The gas program as of March 1918 called for approximately
545 tons of toxic gas weekly.</p>

<p>(2) The Chemical Warfare Service program of August 12, 1918,
called for a much larger amount, viz, about 4,525 tons per week.</p>

<p>(3) The approximate filling capacity of the Edgewood Arsenal
plant from August to November, 1918, was nearly 1,000 tons per
week.</p>

<p>(4) The toxic gas production during this same period increased
from 450 to 675 tons per week.</p>

<p>(5) The capacity of all projectiles received, unlimited by boosters,
varied during the same period from 125 to 450 tons per week.</p>

<p>(6) The maximum capacity corresponding to boosters received
was less than 100 tons per week.</p>

<p>In these facts it will be seen that the numbers of empty shell delivered
to the plant was far less than the number required to accommodate
the gas production. Many of the shell received were without boosters
and therefore without value until boosters were provided, so that the
limiting factor was really the supply of boosters. The booster supply
was sufficient to take care of only a relatively small fraction of the
toxic gas actually produced. The filling capacity of the plant was
also in excess of the delivery of shell and boosters. The 75-millimeter
shell-filling plant had a capacity of 1,200,000 shell per month, eventually
double that, while delivery of shell was slightly over 300,000
per month and of boosters less than 200,000.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of toxic gas it is impossible to store it up
in any large quantities. Early in the summer of 1918 large amounts
were shipped in bulk overseas and there loaded into shell. Later
we received instructions to stop all shipments in bulk except a
limited amount of chlorine, and thereafter our production was
limited to the number of shell and boosters available.</p>

<p>In June, 1918, we shipped in bulk 15 tons of mustard gas, 705 tons
of chlorpicrin, and 48 tons of phosgene. This was to be exchanged
for gas shell produced by the French. In late July the French had
no more extra shell to be filled with American gas and this fact terminated
the arrangement. However, we sold excess gas both to England
and to France. England received 900 tons of our chlorpicrin
and 368 tons of American phosgene. France took 300 tons of
chlorpicrin and 1,408 tons of chlorine, equivalent to 1,226 tons of
phosgene, since phosgene is 80 per cent chlorine including allowance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
for wastage in manufacture. France furnished phosgene shell to
us in exchange for chlorine. In addition 200 tons of mustard gas
were shipped to England and utilized by the English.</p>

<p>We therefore shipped to Europe in bulk 3,662 tons of gas or its
equivalent, which gas was largely loaded in shell and used by the
United States troops or those of the allies. This quantity was
sufficient to load 1,600,000 shell, two-thirds of them being of the
75-millimeter caliber and the other one-third 155-millimeter, the
total number being thought to be at least equal to the total number
of gas shell fired by American troops in action. Thus while American
gas was not actually fired in American shell against the Germans,
American gas was used against the enemy and America
furnished at least as much gas as she fired.</p>

<p>In addition to this we shipped 18,600 Livens drums loaded with
phosgene. These contained 279 tons of gas, and some of them were
fired at the enemy. We began producing loaded gas shell in the
summer of 1918 and by August 9 had shipped 75,000 loaded 75-millimeter
shell. These shell were unassembled for firing in the
guns, the Ordnance Department having decided in June to assemble
gas shell in their cartridge cases in France.</p>

<p>The Chemical Warfare production organization developed and
manufactured a large number of special containers for the shipment
of toxic gases. These were of special construction in order to guard
against dangers that would result from leaks, and all had to stand
the tests required by the Bureau of Explosives before they would be
received for railroad shipment. The 1-ton containers, all of which
would hold 1 ton of liquid chlorine, were designed by the Ordnance
Department and would withstand a pressure of 500 pounds per
square inch. The 300-pound phosgene cylinders, designed by the
Ordnance Department, were made to withstand a 500-pound hydrostatic
pressure and a 250-pound air test.</p>

<p>We purchased standard 55-gallon acid drums and standard-pattern
cylinders for holding 75 pounds of chlorine.</p>

<p>We constructed chlorine tank cars, each tank with a capacity of
15 tons and a strength that could withstand a pressure of 500 pounds
to the square inch. We also designed a tank car originally for the
shipment of chlorpicrin and later used it for shipping sulphur
monochloride.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

GAS DEFENSE EQUIPMENT.</h3>


<p>During the spring and summer of 1917 two marked tendencies
were to be observed in the fighting in France. One of these was the
greatly increased use by both sides of poisonous gases and chemicals,
frightful in their effect; the other the almost complete censorship
that hid the knowledge of this tendency not only from the people
of Europe but particularly from those of the newest belligerent,
America. The French and British Governments, who then controlled
all news from the front, feared, and perhaps with reason, that
if the picture of gas warfare, as it was then developing, should be
placed before the American people, it would result in an unreasonable
dread of gases on the part of the American Nation and its soldiers.</p>

<p>One year later, with tens of thousands of American troops facing
the Germans, there was almost no censorship upon the details of
fighting with chemicals. The mysterious gases of 1917 were then
known to almost every reading individual in the civilized world.
The once secret formulas were published in the technical journals.
Non-censored photographs of defensive equipment were freely published,
and masks and other paraphernalia were exhibited for the
public interest. Except for secret plans for the future and the various
surprises being prepared by one or more of the belligerents, the
whole subject of chemical warfare had become an open book.</p>

<p>What occasioned this change in policy on the part of governing
authorities? The reason was that the American troops brought with
them to France the best and most protective gas masks the world
had seen; and they brought these with them by the millions. Starting
a mask-production effort in May, 1917, America turned out a
total of 5,250,000 gas masks before the armistice was signed, and
sent more than 4,000,000 of them overseas. As to the quality of
these masks, it is only necessary to say that they gave twenty times
the protection afforded by the best German gas masks. In other
words, we protected our soldiers against the poisons which Germany
had brought into warfare, and protected them completely. No
American soldier was ever gassed due to the failure of an American
gas mask, and such gas casualties as did occur were due to the fact
that the masks were not quickly enough utilized when gas was
thrown over, or because the soldier was unaware of the presence of
gas. With such protection there was no longer reason to fear that
the frightfulness of chemical warfare would reduce American morale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>The production of gas masks was one of the most picturesque and
successful phases of our entire war preparation. It engaged the
attention of some of the principal chemical engineers of the country,
and millions of men, women, and children in the United States contributed
something to the success of the undertaking, if only to obey
the "Eat More Coconut" slogan or to save peach stones for the
benefit of the production of the charcoal essential to efficient gas
masks.</p>

<p>The problem of making masks in such quantity and under such
supreme demands for perfection was one which might well stagger
manufacturers accustomed to large-scale operations. We started in
with practically no knowledge whatsoever of the fundamental
principles of a perfect mask. Yet the apparatus was as difficult to
build as a rifle. It must, perforce, be made of perishable materials,
and this fact brought the question of durability to the fore at the
very start. It was evident that no chemical substances known in
our past commercial life would give protection against the new
poisons which had been developed in Europe. With the exception
of phosgene and chlorine, the various war gases which had been
brought out prior to our entrance in the struggle were completely
unknown in our trade or commerce and had existed
only in our experimental laboratories. Then it was discovered that
as these toxins increased in power they could penetrate the ordinary
fabrics known in commerce, and this necessitated the creation of
new types of materials to be used in the masks. Finally the increasing
use of gases forced the soldiers to wear their masks for much longer
periods than had been necessary at the beginning of gas warfare;
so that the problem of comfort became one of great importance.
All of these basic considerations indicate to some extent the difficulty
of the undertaking.</p>

<p>The chlorine, which floated in a pale greenish-yellow cloud down
upon the defenseless Canadian troops at Ypres, with such terrible
effect upon the men, was, as has been said, the first gas used. Chlorine,
though easy to obtain, the principal source of supply being
common table salt, was, from the standpoint of strategy, far from
being the ideal gas of warfare. Troops could be quickly and easily
protected from it. But even as it was, only lack of faith in their
new weapon prevented the Germans from winning the war with
it then and there. Had they brought into the fighting a sufficient
supply of this chlorine, they might have gassed their way to Paris
in short order. In fact, they brought to the line an almost negligible
supply and they themselves were insufficiently protected to go
through their own gas and follow up the attack. By the time they
were able to renew gas warfare the French and British had equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
themselves with masks which were sufficient to protect men against
chlorine.</p>

<p>Thereafter the tendency was toward new and strange gases which
were heavy in weight and highly toxic in their physiological action.
This development led to new, slightly volatile liquids, the so-called
mustard gas being the best example. Mustard gas (properly called
dichlorethyl sulphide) is similar to lubricating oil in many of its
physical characteristics but smells like ordinary mustard. Ground
soaked with the mustard gas remains impregnated for days, the vapor
rising continually.</p>

<p>A perfect mask is one which will remove completely every trace
of gas or poisonous vapor before the air can reach the eyes, nose, or
mouth of the soldier.</p>

<p>The first masks adopted by the allies were simply gauze pads
saturated with neutralizing chemicals. These became unsuitable as
soon as new varieties of powerful poisons were brought out. The
mask development thereafter progressed to the box respirator type.
This consisted of a mask or helmet connected to a box filled with
absorbing and neutralizing chemicals which purified the air for the
mask wearer. This was the type of respirator in use to the end of
the fighting.</p>

<p>It is quite clear to us now that only such a mask could be efficient
in chemical warfare, but in the early part of 1917 the matter was not
clear either to us or to the allies. The first requisitions from the
A. E. F. called for masks of two types, each soldier to be supplied
with one of each. The reserve mask was to be of the gauze type
and the regular mask of the box respirator type, affording protection
from the more powerful poisons that were then just coming into use.
We wasted considerable energy at the beginning in our attempt to
produce both types. Eventually, however, when we were just ready
to start manufacturing the gauze-type mask, orders came to abandon
the effort, since it was even then apparent that our soldiers must be
prepared at all times to withstand all gases.</p>

<p>The box respirator equipment, the general principle of which was
finally adopted by all the nations at war, fell into two classes. In a
single-protection mask the wearer breathed air from inside of the
face piece, so that any leakage around the edges of the face piece
would result in a casualty when the wearer was in a strong concentration
of gas. The other sort, known as the double-protection mask,
consisted of a gas-tight face piece, similar to that of the single-protection
mask. In this type, to guard against any possible leakage
around the edges between the mask and the wearer's skin, the breathing
system was sealed away from the air inside the face piece by
means of a rubber mouthpiece and a nose clip, the wearer inhaling
through the mouthpiece.</p>

most used by our troops.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>The United States and English double-protection masks consisted
of 11 principal parts as follows:</p>

<p>1. A knapsack slung from the shoulder or neck. This contained
the canister and a pocket for storing away the mask when not in use.</p>

<p>2. A metal canister in which was contained the absorptive neutralizing
chemicals.</p>

<p>3. A flexible hose reaching from the canister to the face piece.</p>

<p>4. A flutter, or exhalation, valve, which opened when the wearer
exhaled his breath and closed when he inhaled, thus bringing the
inhalation through the canister but allowing the exhalation from the
lungs to pass out without polluting the chemicals of the canister.</p>

<p>5. The face piece, or hood, fitting snugly around the edges and
covering the eyes, cheeks, lower forehead, nose, mouth, and chin.</p>

<p>6. The eyepieces, or lenses, through which vision was maintained.</p>

<p>7. An elastic harness for the head, to hold the face piece in place.</p>

<p>8. A body cord to tie around the chest and hold the knapsack
firmly, so that the mask could be seized in both hands and pulled
out of the knapsack.</p>

<p>9. A metal flange connection or angle tube which carried the hose
through the face piece to the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>10. A rubber mouthpiece through which the wearer breathed and
which helped to hold the mask in place.</p>

<p>11. A wire nose spring and rubber nose pad to hold the nostrils
shut and force breathing through the mouth.</p>

<p>The first order for gas masks was issued on May 16, 1917, when the
Chief of Staff asked the Surgeon General to supply 1,100,000 masks
before June 30, 1918, or within about one year. Meanwhile 25,000
masks were needed at once in order to equip Gen. Pershing's first
division, then about to sail overseas. There was but one man in the
Army who knew anything at all about the subject and who could
even attempt to produce this quantity in three weeks. This was
Maj. (later colonel) L. P. Williamson, of the Surgeon General's Department,
who had been spending some months at the Army War
College at Washington studying as a side issue such papers on gas
warfare as came from abroad. It was due to his knowledge and the
volunteer staff of the Bureau of Mines that we were able to begin
the actual manufacture of masks within a few days after the requirements
were fixed, and actually to turn out 25,000 masks in but little
more than three weeks' time.</p>

<p>Col. Williamson's first step was to consult with Dr. Van. H. Manning,
the Director of the Bureau of Mines, and with his assistant,
Mr. G. A. Burrell. Since February, 1917, the Bureau of Mines had
been experimenting with gas masks and had built up a corps of
scientists for this work. Within this organization was Mr. Bradley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Dewey, a chemical engineer, who, though then director of the research
laboratory of the American Sheet &amp; Tin Plate Co., of Pittsburgh,
had been loaned to the Bureau of Mines. To Mr. Dewey was
turned over the job of directing the production of the first 25,000
masks for the American troops then sailing.</p>

<p>To produce 25,000 gas masks in three weeks meant to compress
England's two years of experience into 21 days. The military authorities
of this country at that time could plead entire ignorance
of the qualifications of an efficient gas mask. The prevailing idea
seemed to be that you could go out into the market and buy them
by the hundreds of thousands, as you might buy Halloween masks.
But this was not any ordinary poison which we were to fight. These
powerful chemicals attacked the human tissues as would acid. As
the result of the effort, we did supply the first division going overseas
in July. However, the masks were inferior to the British and were
quickly replaced in France by British equipment. It was not until
the following January that we developed an apparatus which we
regarded as satisfactory to undergo the supreme test of battle.</p>

<p>To indicate some of the difficulties overcome between May and
December, 1917, there are here set forth some of the features of an
effective mask.</p>

<p>In the first place, the face piece must fit perfectly; it must not
leak gas around the edges. It must fit into the hollows of the temples
and must give the jaws a free space in which to work, and yet not
slip back and press against one's Adam's apple. The pressure of the
mask on the forehead must come above the supraorbital nerves which
are just above the eyebrows, or else intense headaches will result
from a few moments' wear. Moreover, to fit all faces and heads,
several graduated sizes of masks are required. We first attained
the gas-tight fit with a padded band around the edge of a flexible
rubber-cloth face piece. Later we developed a thicker, stiffer face
piece, but maintained a gas-tight fit by the elasticity of the face piece
and the head harness.</p>

<p>Then the material of the face piece must be gas-tight in itself.
At first we manufactured a fabric made by spreading rubber on
cotton sailcloth; and, after testing it, we found that the smallest
molecule known, that of hydrogen, would not pass through it in large
amounts. This seemed to be a suitable fabric, until tested by the
newer gases. Then we found that some of these gases were soluble in
rubber compounds and could dissolve their way through thin rubber
so quickly that the face piece cloth offered practically no protection
at all. Another difficulty with the rubber fabric was that it was
likely to absorb and hold certain of the poisons, so that a man might
be gassed by the mask itself. The rubber companies, principally
at Akron, Ohio, experimented continually until they discovered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
coating that would not only withstand gas concentrations for a
sufficient time, but would also aerate promptly and lose as much gas
as it had absorbed.</p>

<p>The eyepieces or lenses offered another problem. Celluloid is
strong but it is not so transparent as glass. It ignites easily and is
easily scratched. Glass is ideal in transparency and will not burn,
but is fragile. It was evident that we must provide eyepieces which
would not break easily, since even so slight an accident as the breaking
of a lens might cost a soldier his life by admitting concentrated gas to
the mask. A material known as triplex glass had been experimentally
made. This consisted of a thin celluloid strip sandwiched between
two layers of glass, all three welded together. This glass would not
splinter, and even if cracked or broken, would still be gas-tight. However,
this had never been made in quantity and it was necessary to
work out many kinks and to start a large plant to provide the necessary
millions of lenses.</p>

<p>Then there was also to be overcome the tendency of the eyepieces
to dim, particularly in cold weather, as the wearer breathed moist
breath into the mask. The answer to this problem was a soapy
compound which put a slippery surface on the glass and avoided the
droplets of mist. The first masks were also equipped with deep
plaits so that the wearer could wipe off the lens with the interior of
the face-piece itself, though the final development (the invention of a
Frenchman by the name of Tissot) was to bring the cold air into the
mask so that it flowed directly against the lenses and evaporated any
condensed moisture. This kept them clear under all ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>It was evident that the metal tube passing through the face piece
must not contain pinholes and must be able to stand rough handling
without pulling loose. The harness must maintain a gas-tight connection
between the wearer's face and the face piece, but not at the
cost of pain or chafing of the face or head. The flutter valve must
fit with absolute tightness and must work perfectly and instantaneously
at all times.</p>

<p>The flexible hose leading from the canister to the face piece must
be strong and without flaws or leaks, and yet flexible in the extreme.
A stiff hose would be likely to swing and displace the face piece
whenever the wearer moved. The mouthpiece must be comfortable
and must be built along lines to prevent irritation to the gums or lips,
yet it must be reinforced so that in his excitement the soldier can not
bite down and shut off his air supply.</p>

<p>The canister must withstand corrosion and must be gas-tight.
Smooth sided canisters can not be used, for the gas would slip up the
sides without coming in contact with much of the chemical filling.
The sides of the canisters were, therefore, ribbed so that the charcoal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
and other ingredients working into these ribs baffled the gas and threw
it out into the body of the chemicals. The canister, moreover, must
be equipped with a perfectly working check valve which will stop
exhalation through the canister and force the air to pass out through
the flutter valve.</p>

<p>The web sling of the knapsack must not curl and chafe the neck or
shoulders of the wearer. The knapsack must be waterproof and
must have easily and quickly workable fastenings.</p>

<p>The canisters were filled with charcoal and with cement granules.
These were crushed into carefully sized small bits about the size of a
pinhead and packed in layers in the canisters. The air could pass
through them easily and the particles of both substances absorbed gas.
The chief quality requirements for the carbon and the cement were
that they must have long life and great activity.</p>

<p>Of the canister ingredients the charcoal offered the more difficult
technical problem. It had long been known that charcoal was
highly absorptive of certain gases, but except in rare instances no
thorough study had ever been made of the subject. It was evident,
however, that the more charcoal or carbon which could be packed
into the canister and still allow the free passage of air the greater
the amount of gas that would be absorbed. Consequently a search
was made for carbon existing in the natural state in the most compact
form. This search is described later.</p>

<p>Each canister also contained concrete granules in a definite proportion
to the carbon pieces. These granules were made of cement
mixed with strong alkalis and oxidizing agents to digest the poisons
as they passed through the canister.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the manufacture of good gas masks was a
highly technical undertaking, one calling for the best talents of
eminent men of science. The mask was not something that could
be improvised on the spur of the moment, but each part of it must
be worked out after the most painstaking research. The Gas
Defense Division of the Chemical Warfare Service never at any time
approved a type of mask which its own officers or men did not themselves
wear in the most deadly concentrations of gas.</p>

<p>To get back to the chronological order of development, on May 21,
1917, the making of the first 25,000 masks was started with frantic
haste; though, as it developed later, there was no need for such an
effort, since there were available in England and France plenty of
masks for the first American troops. Working to produce in the
shortest possible time some sort of protection for the first overseas
division, the officers in charge were forced to adopt methods which,
had they been followed throughout the manufacturing program,
would have been extremely costly. There was no time then to
stop and study the problem either here or abroad. Before the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
of June 20,088 masks had been started overseas, and 5,000 more
were ready a little later. The most that can be said for this effort
was that it gave our officers the experience which was the groundwork
of the solid development later on.</p>

<p>The production of these first 25,000 masks called upon the services
of various manufacturers. The assembling of the masks was conducted
by the American Can Co., at Brooklyn, N. Y. The B. F.
Goodrich Co., of Akron, manufactured the face pieces with the eyepieces
inserted, also the connecting hose, the check valve of the
canister, the flutter valve, and the rubber mouthpiece. The American
Can Co. produced the canisters. The Day Chemical Co., of
Westline, Pa., gave the charcoal its first burning. The Ward
Baking Co., of Brooklyn, patriotically baked the charcoal&mdash;to activate
it&mdash;in their bread ovens free of charge. The General Chemical Co.,
of New York, supplied the soda-lime granules. The Doehler Die
Casting Co., of Brooklyn, manufactured the angle tubes. The
Simmons Hardware Co., of St. Louis, produced the waterproof
knapsacks. The Seaver Howland Press, of Boston, printed the
cards of instructions that went with the mask outfit; and the Beetle
&amp; MacLean Manufacturing Co., of Boston, printed the record tags.</p>

<p>Though Maj. (now colonel) Williamson was formally in charge of
this emergency work, he requisitioned the masks from the Bureau
of Mines, which took entire charge of the first contract. Following
this, on August 31, 1917, the Gas Defense Service of the Surgeon
General's Department was established by official order, and Mr.
Dewey, who had been working as a volunteer in the Bureau of
Mines, was commissioned major and put in charge.</p>

<p>The next step was to prepare for the permanent development and
manufacture of gas masks. Contracts were let for the manufacture
of 320,000 component parts of masks as we then knew them, and a
price was fixed for the assembling of the entire original requirement
of 1,100,000 masks. The assembling contract went to the Hero
Manufacturing Co., of Philadelphia, which remained until the end
of the war the sole private contractor assembling our gas masks.</p>

<p>The spirit of cooperation and desire to serve the Government was
evident from the start. The B. F. Goodrich Co. had been the only
producers of the rubber parts of the first 25,000 masks. In this
original contract it had gained valuable technical and cost knowledge;
but in order that the Government might not be limited to one source
of supply for such parts, the Goodrich Co. voluntarily imparted to
the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and to the United States Rubber
Co. the information that would enable them to bid intelligently for
portions of the work. This was a distinct departure from the usual
practice in competitive industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>All during the fall of 1917 and early winter of 1917-18 the development
of the mask continued, the Government experts working hand
in hand with private contractors. Because of the newness of this
sort of manufacture and because of the wide variety of unusual articles
required, entailing in some instances the actual creation of hitherto
unknown commodities, the Government at all times was required to
act as the procurer of raw materials for the masks. In this period of
development America designed her own typical mask&mdash;a gradual
evolution, but one which, though based on the British design, arrived
at a perfection which had been unknown in warfare before.</p>

<p>The triplex glass used in the eyepieces was a patented commodity
produced only in one small factory in Philadelphia. It was necessary
to expand the facilities for the production of this necessary material.
Meanwhile some of the men engaged in the work had improved the
eyepiece by providing it with an aluminum mounting. But this
very improvement brought embarrassment to the work, since the
Akron rubber contracts had provided for eyepieces inserted in the
fabric itself, and to apply the aluminum frame brought about a radical
change in the manufacturing methods at the rubber factories.</p>

<p>There were also many other problems that had to be solved before
our authorities were satisfied to go ahead in quantity production.
There was the matter of rubberizing the face-piece fabric, for instance.
Two methods of rubberizing cloth were in use. The first method was
to roll out a thin sheet of rubber and then press it into the cloth
fabric by running the whole thing under heavy rollers. This was
known as the calender method. The other method, called the
spreader method, was more intricate. In this process the sailcloth,
tightly stretched, was carried around a roller. Above the roller a few
thousandths of an inch was a knife blade extending from edge to
edge. The rubber compound in liquid form was then fed upon the
roller in such manner that a thin film of it pressed under the knife
blade and upon the cloth on the roller. The rubberizing method
finally adopted was a combination of the calender and spreader
methods. The rubber was applied green to the cloth. The curing
process thereafter was highly important. If the curing process
were too short, the rubber would be sticky and would pull off the
sailcloth too easily. If the rubber were over-cured, it would crack
and split.</p>

<p>Nothing short of absolute perfection in every part would do, since
the slightest imperfection anywhere was likely to cost a man his life.
Consequently we installed at the various producing plants not only
100 per cent inspection, but we constructed laboratories for putting
the materials through the most elaborate and exhaustive sorts of
control tests, and then reinspected the parts at the assembly plants,
both before and after the assembly.</p>

<p>All the rubber used was continually sampled and analyzed in the
laboratories. The tensile strengths of all fabrics were determined by
standard destructive tests. We also tested the adhesion of the rubber
coating by standard chemical methods and worked out flexibility
tests for the breathing tube.</p>

<p>After all of the factory inspection and material-control tests, the
masks themselves were sampled and worn in highly toxic atmospheres.
In this work thousands of our masks were worn by the officers and
men of the Gas Defense Division in concentrated atmospheres of the
most deadly gases. For such work we constructed testing rooms
whose atmosphere could be completely exhausted and changed in 90
seconds. The efficiency of canisters was tested either by the lungs
of the inspectors or by mechanical breathing into telltale solutions.</p>

<p>The story of the carbon (charcoal) which went into the American
canister is one of the most interesting phases of the whole undertaking.
Investigations carried on by the research staff of the National Carbon
Co., aided by a clue from the University of Chicago, led to the selection
of coconut shell as a raw material. Any carbon absorbs a definite
number of times its weight of gas. Therefore the densest carbons
will be most efficient, volume for volume, as gas absorbers in a given
space. Coconut shells and other nut shells were found to be the most
compact form in which carbon exists in nature in commercially
practicable quantities, being considerably superior in this respect to
anthracite coal and to such woods as ironwood and mahogany.
Another essential for charcoal used in the canisters was that it must
be so hard that it would not crumble easily and produce dust that
would clog up the air passages and prevent easy breathing through
the canister. Coconut shell fulfilled both of these conditions better
than any other known material.</p>

<p>Further study by the National Carbon Co., backed up by wonderful
large-scale development work, paid for and carried out by the
National Electric Lamp Association under the direction of their
Mr. F. N. Dorsey (who later became Col. Dorsey and chief of the
Development Division of the Chemical Warfare Service), gave us
the details of a new process for treating the charcoal to make it
absorptive. After the original burning of the nut shells, or other
carbon materials, the resulting carbon was given a second highly
specialized heat treatment, and this activated it until it had a powerful
affinity for gas. Such carbon, made from nutshell material, would
absorb 150 times its own volume of chlorpicrin, one of the most
deadly of the war gases, the action being approximately instantaneous.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that investigation of carbons
stopped with these experiments. In the search for the ideal carbon
we experimented with almost every hard vegetable substance
known. Literally, hundreds of kinds of carbon were tested. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
to coconut shells, the fruit pits, several common varieties of nuts
abundant in the United States, and several tropical nuts, were found
to make the best carbon. Pecan nuts, and all woods ranging in
hardness from ironwood down to ordinary pine and fir, were found
to be in the second class of efficiency. Among other substances
tested were almonds, Arabian acorns, grape seeds, Brazil-nut husks,
balsa, osage oranges, Chinese velvet beans, synthetic carbons, cocoa
bean shells, coffee grounds, flint corn, corn cobs, cottonseed husks,
peanut shells and oil shale. While many of these substances might
have been used in an emergency, none of them would produce
carbon as efficient, volume for volume, as that of the coconut shells
and other hard nuts.</p>

<p>Some idea of the scale of the American mask production may be
seen in our requirements for coconut shells. In our survey of raw
materials we included the entire coconut resources of the world.
Such figures were relatively easy to obtain because the copra, or
dried coconut meat, industry is an important one, particularly in
southern Asia and the South Sea Islands of the Pacific. Ceylon was
the greatest single source of coconuts, 2,300,000,000 nuts being
gathered there annually. British India was next with 1,500,000,000
nuts. Our own Philippine Islands were third, with an annual production
of 900,000,000 nuts. Then followed in order the Dutch
East Indies, British Malaya, French Indo-China, Siam, and the
Pacific archipelagos, the total production of the Orient being
7,450,200,000 nuts annually. This was a supply that would provide
4,000 tons of coconut shells every day. The total production of
coconuts in Central America, the West Indies and the Caribbean
coast of South America amounted to 131,000,000 nuts annually,
equal to a supply of 75 tons of shells daily.</p>

<p>When we first began to build masks our demands for carboniferous
material ranged from 40 to 50 tons a day of raw material; but by
the end of the war, due to vastly increased mask requirements, we
were in need of a supply of 400 tons of coconut shells per day. This
demand would absorb the entire coconut production of the tropical
Americas five times over. It was equal to one-tenth of the total
coconut production of the Orient. Since transportation from the
oriental countries was out of the question on the scale demanded by
our mask program, it was evident that we were likely to be seriously
embarrassed by the lack of raw materials; and, indeed, at no time
before September, 1918, did we have on hand a reserve supply of
shells and other charcoal materials that would last for more than a
few days, though at no time after the start was the actual output of
masks retarded by lack of these materials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>In building up our supply of coconut shells we naturally turned
first to the resources in the United States. America normally consumes
fresh coconuts at a rate sufficient to supply about 50 tons of
shells daily. The war restrictions on the use of sugar had the
effect of cutting down the consumption of coconuts, used largely in
candy and cakes, and consequently one of our efforts was to increase
by widespread propaganda the use of coconut. The "Eat-More-Coconut"
campaign more than doubled the American consumption
of coconut in a brief space of time; and the 50 tons of shells daily,
which had been the original supply, grew in volume until in October,
1918, with the help of importations of shell, we averaged about 150
tons per day exclusive of the Orient.</p>

<p>The first heating of coconut shells to make charcoal reduces their
weight 75 per cent. Therefore it was evident that we could most
economically ship our oriental supply in the form of charcoal produced
on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. For this purpose, in
August, we established under the direction of an officer of the Chemical
Warfare Service a charcoal plant in the Philippine Islands.
From this plant agents were sent to Ceylon, India, Siam, and other
oriental countries to purchase enormous supplies of nutshells.
This work was only gaining momentum when the armistice was
declared. As it was, the Philippine charcoal plant actually shipped
over 300 tons of coconut shell carbon to the United States and had
1,000 tons on hand ready for shipment on November 11.</p>

<p>The method adopted in the Philippines was to burn the shells in
long, shallow trenches. As soon as the smoke had disappeared and the
flames came clear and lambent through the incandescent mass, the
bed of coals was smothered by means of galvanized-iron lids thrown
over the trenches. It is interesting to note that the coolies hired by
the Chemical Warfare Service in the Philippines would not work at
charcoal burning more than a few hours each day, because they
declared that the heat from the pits would give them tuberculosis
and other lung troubles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile agents and officers of the Gas Defense Division were
searching the tropical regions of Central and South America for other
nuts valuable for this purpose. The best of these was found to be
the cohune or corozo nut. These nuts are the fruit of the Manaca
palm tree. They grow in clusters, like bananas or dates, one to
four clusters to a tree, each cluster yielding from 60 to 75 pounds of
nuts. Cohune nuts grow principally on the west coast of Central
America in low, swampy regions from Mexico to Panama, but are
also found along the Caribbean coast. Before the war created a
demand for cohune nuts none of them had ever been imported commercially
in this country, although it is understood that France had
a prewar commercial use for them.</p>

<p>The chief virtue of the cohune nut from our point of view was its
extreme thickness of shell, the kernel of this large nut, which is 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
inches or more in length and nearly 2 in diameter, being relatively
small. We were importing cohune nuts at the rate of 4,000 tons per
month at the time of the armistice. A disadvantage in the use of
cohune nuts was that their husks contained a considerable amount
of acid which rotted the jute bags and also caused the heaps of nuts
to heat in storage. The fire department at the Chemical Warfare
Service nut storehouse at Astoria, N. Y., was kept busy putting out
spontaneous blazes in the storage piles of cohune nuts. We also sent
agents to West Africa and there arranged for the shipment of some
hundred tons of palm nuts a month.</p>

<p>A third source of tropical material was in the ivory nuts used in
considerable quantities in this country by the makers of buttons.
In the button factories in this country there is considerable waste of
this nut material, amounting to 400 or 500 tons a month, this waste
including the nut dust which was useless to us and had to be screened
out. The price of ivory-nut waste was high, because of the use of
this material in the manufacture of lactic acid. Nevertheless, we
used a considerable quantity of it.</p>

<p>Another great branch of activity in securing carbon supplies was
undertaken in this country. In the search for fruit pits and for
domestic nuts it was found that the quantity of apricot pits, peach
pits, cherry pits (largely from the canning industry), and walnut
shells on the Pacific coast amounted to 23,600 tons annually. We
arranged for the whole Pacific coast supply of these commodities
and converted a part of a San Francisco plant of the Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. into a plant for the preliminary carbonization of 100
tons a day of these materials.</p>

<p>The next step was to turn to the consumers of the country and ask
them to save their peach and apricot stones, their prune, plum, and
olive pits, their date seeds, cherry pits, butternut shells, Brazil nut
shells, and their walnut and hickory nut shells. The work of securing
these and advertising the Government's need to the public was
turned over to the American Red Cross. There was some question
at the start as to whether the charter of the Red Cross would permit
it to undertake such a war activity; but, since it was determined
that this was purely a defensive operation, the legal forces of the
Red Cross decided that the organization could go into a campaign
of this kind.</p>

<p>"Help us to give him the best gas mask." That was the slogan
which was carried on the posters, catching the attention of almost
every person in the United States. More than 1,000,000 pieces of
literature were distributed. The Red Cross established 163 collection
points, and collection barrels appeared on the streets of practically
every community in the United States. The Junior Red
Cross, the Food Administration, and the Department of Agriculture
gave valuable assistance. The Boy Scouts organized nut gathering
parties. The governor of Massachusetts proclaimed November 9,
1918, to be gas mask day for the collection of carbon material,
and 28 other States fixed gas mask days in November. Two reels
of motion pictures were shown through the country. Journalists
aided the campaign in newspapers and magazines. Frederic J.
Haskin sent out a valuable article which was published in many
of the important newspapers of the United States. One Oklahoma
town took a day off en masse and gathered a whole carload of nuts.</p>

<p>This campaign started September 13, 1918, but was abruptly cut
short on the 11th of November. Thus it is impossible to give exactly
the result of it, since many of the scheduled shipments of nuts and
fruit pits were canceled and found their way into fuel bins. However,
at one time there were on the rails, en route to the carbon
plant at Astoria, 100 carloads of materials supplied by the patriotism
of the American people. It was estimated that some 4,000 tons
were collected in this brief period, exclusive of the material from the
California canning industry.</p>

<p>The procurement of the nuts, however, was but the first step in
the production of carbon for use in our mask canisters, for after
charcoal is first burned its pores are still filled with various impurities
which may be summed up by the word "tar." When the charcoal
was given a second heating, under careful temperature regulation,
this tar was burned out, with the result that the charcoal itself
became much more active in its absorption of gas. In fact, properly
activated charcoal is more than absorptive&mdash;it is catalytic in its
action toward the gaseous poisons used in the war, not only absorbing
them but hastening their breakdown (digestion) into less injurious
substances.</p>

<p>The activating of charcoal offered at the start considerably more of
a problem than the question of making the charcoal itself, since
activating had never before been conducted on a commercial scale.
Two months of experimentation showed us that the best distillation
of shells and pits for charcoal was that conducted in illuminating-gas-making
retorts. The activation thereafter had to be done in special
equipment permitting of fine control of temperature. The Government
eventually spent more than $1,000,000 in a charcoal activating
plant, providing for America the best protection known to science
against the poisons which Germany had introduced into warfare.</p>

<p>The cement granules, which also had to go into the canisters, supplied
another problem. We originally used a special soda-lime for
this material, but only obtained a satisfactory product after Maj.
H. W. Dudley, R.E., came to America as our British advisor and
brought to us the British granule formula. The basis of this cement
was lime, to absorb gases of an acid nature. Portland cement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
used, to give hardness and prevent disintegration and the formation
of dust in the canister. Then infusorial earth was added, to make the
compound porous in texture. A little sodium hydroxide was put in,
to increase the alkalinity of the mixture. Finally there was an
infusion of sodium permanganate, which is a powerful oxidizing
agent. This latter chemical was added as a precaution against
arsine. Arsine and arsenical compounds were difficult to use in
warfare, but the Germans had introduced them to some extent, justifying
us in adding this protection.</p>

<p>In making the granules the sodium permanganate solution was
mixed with the cement. The mixture was roughed out into slabs,
allowed to set for three days, dried, ground up, screened to the proper
size, and packed in drums for future use.</p>

<p>As has been noted, the charcoal and cement were packed in the
canister in alternate layers. The cement had the virtue of working
while the carbon slept&mdash;that is, the carbon was active when there
were gases present to be absorbed, but the cement kept on thereafter,
digesting the gases which had been absorbed by the charcoal. The
cement was not quick in action, but it had a remarkable capacity for
consuming some poisons.</p>

<p>To return to the chronological development of manufacturing
facilities, after we had placed the contracts for the first 1,000,000
masks in the early fall of 1917, we began looking around for facilities
for producing carbon and cement in the quantities which we should
need in the near future. We found at Astoria, the district near Hell
Gate at the junction of the East River and Long Island Sound in
New York, the large gas works of the Astoria Light, Heat &amp; Power Co.
perhaps the largest illuminating-gas plant in the world. This was a
subsidiary of the Consolidated Gas Co. of New York, which concern
readily agreed to turn over to the Government some of its retorts
and to permit the construction of a Government-operated plant on its
grounds. We might have been seriously delayed in the production
of gas masks except for the extraordinary and continuing efforts of
Mr. W. Cullen Morris, Chief Construction engineer of the Consolidated
Gas Co., and Mr. Addicks, its vice president. It was due to Mr.
Morris that a $150,000 granule plant was constructed, heavy complicated
equipment installed, and operations started in the short
space of 30 days.</p>

<p>Let us now go back to the history of actual mask production.
At the start it was estimated that when the Hero Manufacturing Co.
had reached full capacity it could assemble and turn out 6,000 masks
a day. The fuel shortage and the railroad congestion of the late fall
and early winter of 1917-18 hampered our supplying the Hero
Manufacturing Co. with parts, until the mask production, averaging
2,430 a day as it had in November, dwindled to 1,500 a day in
December. The Goodyear Co. at Akron had meanwhile established
its Akron-Boston motor track line. This was put at the service of
the Gas Defense Division, hauling various supplies from both Akron
and Boston to the assembling plant at Philadelphia. Sometimes in
the mountains of Pennsylvania the trucks would be blocked in snow
and the patriotic citizens of the community would get out with
shovels and work until the supplies again started on their way.</p>

<p>All of the masks produced in the fall of 1917 were still regarded
as experimental and not yet up to the standard of masks which we
were willing to supply for actual service at the front. Consequently,
not one of them was exported, but the entire 1917 production,
after the first order of 25,000, was sent only to the training camps
in this country. By January 8, 1918, we were producing masks
which we were willing to put into actual service, and on that date
the manufacture of masks for export was started.</p>

<p>In January we exported 54,000 masks, which was 16,000 less
than the schedule which we had set for ourselves. But by February
20 we had wiped out this deficit with a little over, for our schedule
by that date called for the production of 141,000 gas masks, and
we had produced 142,000.</p>

<p>Late in the fall of 1917 the requirements of the Expeditionary
Forces were reanalyzed in the light of information gathered abroad
and in accordance with the new military program. Requirements were
multiplied almost fourfold. Let us see how these requirements were
met, and what difficulties were solved in the course of the effort.</p>

<p>Experience had already shown that for many reasons the Government
needed its own mask factory, where improvements could be
adopted as soon as made and where inspections and the storage
of parts could be more centralized than in private plants.</p>

<p>With the necessary expansion then confronting us, any other
policy would have meant making face pieces in half a dozen or more
private plants, all starting at once with organizations untrained
for this work. This would have been fatal, for even with the
Goodyear and Goodrich companies manufacturing face pieces in Akron
and the Kenyon Manufacturing Co. making them in Brooklyn, we
found it most difficult to maintain uniform standards in all the plants.
As new points came up, it was constantly necessary to interchange
inspection personnel and to send men from one plant to another
to teach manufacturing wrinkles. Such practices consumed more
personnel than we could train in the time available. Moreover,
it was impossible under the conditions that we were then facing to
build up more than barely adequate supplies of gas mask parts and
such raw materials as special fabrics. To have operated many
more face-piece plants would have meant to divide these stocks of
fabrics, elastic, tape, etc., still further. To have kept each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
these plants properly stocked, under the existing traffic conditions,
would have been impossible. A big central gas-defense plant
was the only solution of our difficulties.</p>

<p>The order approving the establishment of the gas-defense plant
was signed by Secretary Baker on November 20, 1917. The officers
of the Gas Defense Division found in Long Island City, not far
from the new chemical plant at Astoria, a group of modern concrete
factory buildings which had been put up in this newly developed
section by several different concerns, among them the Ford Motor
Co., the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., and the National Casket Co.
One of these buildings, known as the Stewart Building, was taken
over by the Government and modern machinery was installed.
Mr. R. R. Richardson, of Chicago, was appointed plant manager
with a salary of $1 per year. He quickly set to work organizing
the factory and its staff. On January 9, 1918, the first few factory
operators were hired. Five days later the executive offices at the
plant were ready for occupancy. The plant grew apace. One by
one the other buildings were absorbed and added to the establishment&mdash;first
the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber building, then the National
Casket building. Next a long storage building was built between
the Stewart and the Goodyear buildings. Runways were built
which connected up the various buildings, and, finally, in July,
the Ford Motor building was taken over and connected up to complete
the group.</p>

<p>Thus by the summer of 1918 we occupied five large buildings,
with a total of over 1,000,000 square feet, or 20 acres, of floor space,
connected up to make the gas-defense plant. Of the 12,000
employees in this plant, 8,600 were women. Endeavors were made
as far as possible to hire those who had near relatives with the
American Expeditionary Forces. The degree of care required in the
manufacture of masks was beyond anything known in normal industry,
and we rightly believed that this personal interest in the
work would bring about greater care in manufacture and inspection.
Since the factory was working at top speed a great deal of attention
was paid to welfare work. Women employees were given 12-minute
rest periods both in the morning and the afternoon, and completely
furnished attractive rest and recreation rooms were set apart for
women in the factory.</p>

<p>The plant was unique in more than one respect. At the very start
it attempted the supposedly impossible, for it combined in its staff
and in its working organization civilian and military personnel. The
manager was a civilian, the assistant manager was Lieut. Col. Coonley.
Below them on the next tier of the organization were Army officers
in charge of several departments and civilians in charge of others.
Throughout the plant were certain groups of women workers or
inspectors in charge of civilians were others; in charge of sergeants or
even privates. The arrangement worked out well and the whole organization
pulled together as one team, without reference to civilian
or military status. Again, at the start there was laid down a policy of
inspection at every single stage of manufacture. The incoming parts,
though already inspected at their source, were reinspected and
retested. After every operation in the manufacture of the face piece
there came an inspection by specially trained women set apart from
the operators. Then again, there was a special control inspection.
After the face piece was finished, and when assembly was complete,
the entire mask went to a final inspection where it was looked over
by several trained women, who worked in dark closets and inspected
the face pieces over a bright light to make sure that no pin pricks had
been made, either maliciously or otherwise. Furthermore, wherever
there was an inspector there was a system of checking his or her
accuracy, for 5 per cent of every inspector's work was periodically
selected at random and checked over by other inspectors.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with this went many of the latest developments of
factory operation. The best machinery was employed, conveyors
were used wherever possible, and, when changes in the size of the
operation or the design of the mask made it advisable, the factory was
at once rearranged in order that the flow might always be orderly
and continuous.</p>

<p>From all of this the reader might judge that the operation, lasting,
as it did, for only a little more than eight months, was a costly
one. Such, however, was not the case, for a well-ordered and accurate
cost system, kept from the very start in accordance with the best
practices of factory accounting, showed that after charging in all
equipment changes and overhead, the plant made complete masks
which cost the Government about 50 cents per mask less than it cost
to get complete masks by purchasing parts and assembling them
under private contracts.</p>

<p>Along with this manufacturing development went the building up
of an elaborate procurement force charged with the responsibility of
providing parts to be assembled at the gas-defense plant and the Hero
Manufacturing Co. This section faced a hard and intricate task, but
though there were instances where a shortage of parts temporarily
slowed down production, these were remarkably few. Many were the
difficulties of buying new parts; many of the parts were the product
of elaborate die work; die makers in the country were overworked.
Specifications had to be written, checked, and approved, and a field
inspection first had to be organized and trained so that the product
from all the different plants could be relied upon as satisfactory for
the assembling plants. But this problem was still further complicated
by ever-recurring changes in design, made necessary as improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
followed improvement. Officers had to be trained in a day and then
sent out to train inspection corps in manufacturing plants in many
parts of the country. Inspection and procurement detachments were
maintained in most of the eastern industrial centers. There were over
100 enlisted men and 9 officers in Akron, 30 enlisted men with 6 officers
in Boston, and men and officers in over 60 cities. Here again the
civilian and Army officer worked hand in hand; for Mr. Robert Skemp,
a volunteer civilian from Pittsburgh, was in charge of this procurement,
reporting to Lieut. Col. Besse and directing an organization
made up almost entirely of officers and enlisted men.</p>

<p>The March output of masks was 183,000; that of April, 363,000;
May, slightly less than this figure; that of June, 504,000; that of
July, 671,000. In all, between January 1 and November 11, 1918,
we built more than 5,000,000 gas masks.</p>

<p>In February, 1918, shortly before the German drive commenced,
we received requisitions for sample lots of oiled mittens and oiled
union suits as protection against mustard gas and also for chloride
of lime to neutralize poison-impregnated earth. In their March drive
the Germans used gas in much more protracted concentrations than
before. Originally the masks had been worn only during the sporadic
gas alarms, and then only for a brief period at a time.</p>

<p>The double-protection mask which we had been building had been
admirable in its day, but it was no longer adapted to the sort of use to
which it was evident it must now be put. In long-continued wear
the mouthpiece would irritate the gums and lips of the soldier, and the
face-piece band would cause excruciating headaches after a few hours.
It had now become frequently necessary for men to wear their masks
for eight hours at a stretch. The word discomfort is a weak description
of the feelings of a man wearing one of our masks for that period.</p>

<p>Our authorities in France decreed for a single-protection mask and
more comfort, even at the expense of a little safety. The result of
these new conditions together with the establishment of closer relationship
with our Expeditionary Forces, through a visit of Col.
Dewey to France, was the determination to build masks in this
country which should give the protection of the masks which we had
been turning out and at the same time be comparatively comfortable.
There had been brought out in France a single-protection mask, that
is, a mask in which the inlet tube entered directly into the space between
the mask and the face, with the orifices so arranged that the
fresh air was drawn across the eyepieces. This was known as the
Tissot mask. The principle of the Tissot was correct as far as comfort
was concerned, since it did away with the irritating mouthpiece,
but the chief danger in this mask arose from the fact that it was
made of thin, pure gum rubber. We took the Tissot and endeavored
to produce a mask of this type which should be gas-tight and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
rugged. In this work we experimented on hundreds of subjects to
determine face and head sizes and shapes. It is interesting to note
in this connection that the size of a man's face has nothing to do
with the size of his head, as large heads with small faces and small
heads with large faces occur not infrequently.</p>

<p>We made two developments of the mask without mouthpiece or
nose clip. Both were ready for field tests in August, 1918. The one
produced in Akron and assembled at the Philadelphia contracting
plant was known as the Akron Tissot, or Type A-T.</p>

<p>At the start of operations in Long Island City Mr. Waldemar
Kops, of New York, a manufacturer of corsets, came to the Government,
asking an opportunity to do his part in the war. He was
assigned to the gas-defense plant, and later, with the commission of
major, took charge of the gas-defense Long Island laboratories.
Maj. Kops had no experience with gas masks until he came to the
gas-defense plant, but his experiments soon led to an improvement
in the design of the Tissot mask. It was called the Type KT mask&mdash;the
Kops-Tissot. Only a few hundred thousand were produced,
though the latest model was scheduled for enormous production
beginning in December, 1918. It possessed much of the protective
efficiency of the old uncomfortable mask, the cut of the face piece
insured a gas-tight connection with the head, it was relatively comfortable,
and it was durable.</p>

<p>The call of the allies in the spring of 1918 for American troops in
as great numbers as the ships could carry them to France resulted in
still further increases in our mask requirements. At the height of
the drive we were making over 40,000 masks a day. Approximately
35,000 employees were engaged in the manufacture of various gas-mask
parts. Our carbon requirements were expanding at a rate
that would have needed 400 tons of raw materials a day by December,
1918. We built 336,919 KT masks and approximately 200,000 A-T
masks. In exact figures the total production of masks of all types
was 5,692,499. Of these 3,666,683 were built at the gas-defense
plant and 2,025,816 were assembled by the Hero Manufacturing Co.
In addition, we furnished 3,189,357 extra filled canisters for the
replacement of those used up by 40 hours of field service.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with this procurement and manufacturing achievement
went the development of the technical section of the Gas
Defense Division. This was known as the Long Island laboratories,
manned by a personnel of several hundred men and officers. Here
in its laboratories were solved the knotty problems that bridged
the gap between experimental work and production. Many new
designs were worked out, only to be rejected when tested. Here
there were workrooms that could make sample lots of 1,000 masks,
and here were located the chemical laboratories and the gas chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
in which the product of the gas-defense plant was tested daily by
control chemical analysis and by actual breathing and wearing tests.</p>

<p>In spite of this elaborate technical section, the testing of masks
did not stop with it. There was a special field-testing section of the
Gas Defense Division, composed of about 150 men who were trained
to the minute in field maneuvers and did most of their work in gas
masks. They were constantly in and out of gas with regular production
and experimental masks, they played baseball in them, they
dug trenches, laid out wire, cut wire, and fought sham battles at
night, both with and without actual gas. This section was not organized
until July, but it should have been one of the first of our
units. It was there that we learned all the fine points of gas mask
comfort and durability. The work of this section even went so far
in the case of the later designs as to include a test where six men
worked, played, and slept in the masks for an entire week, only taking
them off for 30 minutes at each mealtime, and each day entering
high concentrations of the most deadly gases, without any ill effects
whatsoever to the wearers. When it is remembered that eight hours
was the limit of time which a strong man could wear the old-type
mask, something of the efficiency of the new mask may be realized.</p>

<p>We also built 377,881 horse masks. Investigation showed that a
horse's eyes did not shed tears in the presence of even strong lachrymatory
gases. Moreover a horse never breathes through his mouth;
and it was, therefore, necessary only to cover his nostrils. Furthermore,
horses proved to be more resistant to the toxic gases used in
Europe than were men, and his mask, accordingly, needed to be
only a bag of many layers of chemically treated gauze. The horse
masks were all manufactured by the Fifth Avenue Uniform Co., of
New York City, under the supervision of a detachment of the Gas
Defense Division.</p>

<p>We furnished 191,338 dugout blankets to be used at the doors of
dugouts to make them gas proof. These were specially woven all-cotton
blankets which were treated in France with a special heavy
oil, shipped from the United States.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the war we received large requisitions for protective
suits and gloves to safeguard men against mustard gas burns.
The suits were made of oiled fabric and the gloves were of cloth impregnated
with chemicals. As a work just starting, we produced
2,450 suits and 1,773 pairs of gloves.</p>

<p>A total of 1,246 tons of a new ointment known as sag paste was
made and shipped. This was an ointment to protect the skin against
mustard-gas burns.</p>

<p>Gas warning signals were of several types, watchmen's rattles and
Klaxon horns being the most commonly used to sound the gas alarms.
We shipped 45,906 of these special hand horns. The rattles were
secured in Europe.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

SUBSISTENCE.</h3>


<p>When the American soldier went to war against Germany he took
his appetite with him. The task of keeping that appetite satisfied
with good food (and the soldier, therefore, contented and well) fell
to the Quartermaster General. The average American soldier at the
end of the fighting in 1918 is said to have weighed 12 pounds more
than he did when the Selective-Service Act or his own enlistment
brought him into the Army. This is the complete testimonial to the
quality and quantity of the food served to the American troops in
1917 and 1918. Assuming 3,700,000 to have been the greatest number
of Americans under arms, this average increase in weight means
that the beans and bacon and fresh meat of the American Army
ration were transmogrified into some 45,000,000 pounds of Yankee
brawn to be the basis of untold resources of health and energy during
the coming quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Consider these millions of soldiers as one composite, gigantic
man in khaki; compress the war period into a single hour, the
dinner hour; and it will be seen that the American fighter consumed
what might be called a sizeable meal. Let us say that he
started off with the main course. The roast of beef weighed over
800,000,000 pounds. It was flanked by a rasher of bacon weighing
150,000,000 pounds. Over 1,000,000,000 pounds of flour went into
the loaf of bread, while to spread the bread was there a lump of butter
weighing 17,500,000 pounds and another lump of oleomargarine
weighing 11,000,000 pounds. As a side dish this giant had over
150,000,000 pounds of baked beans, half of these coming in cans ready
baked and flavored with tomato sauce. The potatoes weighed
487,000,000 pounds. To add gusto to his appetite there were
40,000,000 pounds of onions. Then scattered over the table were
such items as 150,000,000 cans of corn, peas, and string beans; while
the salad contained 50,000,000 cans of salmon and 750,000 tins of
sardines. Then there was a huge bowl of canned tomatoes, nearly
190,000,000 tins supplying its contents. For dessert he had 67,000,000
pounds of prunes and 40,000,000 pounds of evaporated peaches and
apples. The sugar for sweetening various dishes weighed 350,000,000
pounds. He washed it all down with a draft made of 75,000,000
pounds of coffee thinned with 200,000,000 cans of evaporated milk.
The bill for the meal, paid by the American public, amounted to
$727,092,430.44, this figure to December 1, 1918.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>In supplying such vast quantities of food, scientific attention was concentrated
upon the details of the effort. At the time the armistice was
signed the American troops in France were eating about 9,000,000
pounds of food every day. Never before in history had any nation
been compelled to send subsistence so great a distance to so many
men. It was not possible to ask France and England to divide their
food supplies, as they were already rationing their civilian populations.
We were required to purchase practically all food in America and
transport it nearly 5,000 miles. Ships were relatively scarce. There
was a strong bid for every inch of tonnage space. The tonnage allotted
to subsistence must be filled with sufficient food not only to
supply the immediate consumption, but to overcome losses due to the
sinking of ships and the possible capture of base depots. These contingencies
required two pounds of food to be shipped where one would
ordinarily be sent; yet because of the shortage of ships the subsistence
authorities were asked to pack these two pounds into almost the
space of one. The result was foods in forms never before known by
American soldiers and in some cases never before known at all&mdash;such
forms as dehydrated vegetables, boneless beef, and the so-called
shankless beef. Trench warfare made new demands for food. Calls
came for such rare articles as soluble coffee or the wheat-and-meat
cake of the emergency ration.</p>

<p>These problems were solved only by the assistance of the American
food industry. In numerous instances new factories, or even whole
new types of food manufacture, were built up as rapidly as three
shifts of men could work and money accomplish results.</p>

<p>The cost of food rates high among the war costs of 1917 and 1918.
Back in 1897 the average meal in the Army cost about 4 cents, and
the daily three meals 13 cents. At the end of 1918 the cost of the
ration was approximately 48 cents. The advance was not all due
to the advance in living costs. Much of it was on account of the
improved standards of the ration. In 1916 Congress appropriated
$10,000,000 to feed the Army; the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1918,
brought an appropriation of $830,000,000 for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The American fighting man of 1917-18 was a good feeder. He
ate nearly three-quarters of a ton of food each year, or over ten times
his own weight. Without counting any transportation costs or the
expense of handling at all, each man's yearly supply of food cost
more than $165. In spite of the most rigid and painstaking economies
in the purchase of this subsistence the American people were
paying at the peak of Army expansion more than $2,500,000 per
day to feed the troops.</p>

<p>The distance of the American Expeditionary Forces from the source
of their food supplies required that their food be largely purchased in
nonperishable forms. That is, meats must be cured, meats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
vegetables tinned, vegetables and fruits dried. We literally paved
the way to Berlin with tin cans. The various foods put up in tins
and purchased during the year 1918 totaled over 1,000,000,000 cans,
or enough, standing on end, to make a road wide enough and long
enough for a force of men marching in columns of four to go from
the port of embarkation at Hoboken, N. J., to the heart of Germany.
The largest closing machine can seal 240 tin cans per minute.
If such a machine could be operated eight hours a day seven days a
week, it would take it 23 years and 6 months to seal these tins.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1918, when the demand for men in France
resulted in reducing the available tonnage for supplies, the cry came
from France to cut every nonessential. As a result most of the canned
vegetables and fruits, including peas, corn, sweet potatoes, asparagus,
pineapple, pears, and apples were stricken from the list of food
supplies for the American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>From France came calls for tomatoes and men, men and tomatoes.
This phrase did not mean that bread and bacon, beans and
beef, should be eliminated; but it emphasized the importance of
this one vegetable, the tomato. The total purchases of tomatoes
exceeded those of all other vegetables combined. In addition to
the many ways of serving tomatoes, they were used in the trenches
to relieve thirst, being, perhaps, more effective than any other
substitute for water. Because of its food value and slight acidity,
a quart of tomato juice was worth several quarts of water to the
thirsty men in the field. The Army took 45 per cent of the total
1918 American pack of tomatoes. These tomatoes were bought
from 5,000 firms scattered throughout the rural districts of the
United States.</p>

<p>The demands of the overseas forces for meat during the summer
of 1918 were so heavy that they created a shortage of beef in the
United States. Beef is the mainstay of the soldier's diet. The Army
allows 456 pounds of beef per year for each soldier. This does not
mean that the soldier actually eats that much beef, beef being simply
the Army's meat standard. Pork, usually in the form of bacon, is
substituted for 30 per cent of this quantity of beef, 12 ounces of
bacon being considered the equivalent of 20 ounces of beef. The
major portion of the American Expeditionary Forces' beef was fresh
beef shipped frozen all the way from the packing plants in the
United States to the company kitchens at the front, through an elaborate
system of cold-storage warehouses and refrigerator cars and ships.</p>

<p>The Food Administration asked that the people substitute corn
meal, rye flour, and other grain flour for 20 per cent of the wheat
flour ordinarily used in making bread. The troops in the United
States complied with this ruling and saved 1,000,000 barrels of flour.
The use of substitutes in France was not insisted upon, as bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
making in the field is more difficult. Field bakeries are not adapted
to experimenting with doughs and yeasts, as is required when substitutes
for flour are used. The Army allowance of flour for a year
for one man is 410 pounds. Flour was usually issued in the form of
bread, 1 pound of bread being allowed for each man each day. Other
yearly allowances are 56 pounds of beans, 27 pounds of prunes, 27
pounds of coffee, 73 pounds of sugar, 11&frac12; pounds of condensed milk,
3&frac12; pounds of vinegar, and 13&frac12; pounds of salt. For variety other
items are specified which may be substituted for these foods.</p>

<p>Food was purchased by the Quartermaster's Department and
furnished to the individual companies at cost of the food. In charge
of the mess was a sergeant, who had had special instruction in schools
as to methods of feeding the Army. The mess sergeant checked
over his stocks daily and made up a list of what he would require
for the coming day. This list, in turn, was given to the camp supply
officer, under whose direction the order was made up and delivered

<p>This order was based on a ration allowance, as has been stated, a
ration being the food required to subsist one man for one day. The

<p>The ration at home was practically the same. The home ration,
however, did not include candy and tobacco. The commanding
officer had authority to modify or change all rations to meet special
conditions. For instance, in times of great cold and when the men
were subject to great exposure, or after long and tedious campaigns
or marches, or when the work required of the troops was abnormal,
the ration might be increased. The ration also included soap, candles,
matches, towels, and a few other items considered necessary in
the daily life of a soldier. The value of a ration fluctuated with the
market from month to month. Each day's food weighed about 4.6
pounds per man.</p>

<p>The men actually in the trenches sometimes made use of the
emergency ration, the little flat can of compressed nourishment which
every soldier carried in his pocket. This ration, however, was used
only in severe straits, on the order of an officer, or on the enlisted
man's own responsibility in the direst emergency, when the activity
of the enemy made it impossible to get hot food to the men during
daylight hours. Hot food was served in the trenches whenever
possible. The hot food consisted principally of soups and soluble
coffee. Specially constructed cans, made on the principle of thermos
bottles, kept the food hot when it was being carried to the front.
The chief quartermaster of the American Expeditionary Forces
relates that on a tour of inspection made by him, during the Argonne-Meuse
offensive, on November 1, 1918, he inspected the meals served
at noon to the troops of the Fifth Corps actually engaged in battle on
that day, and found in a number of cases that Artillery organizations
were being served beefsteak, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, white
bread and butter, rice pudding, and hot coffee, the men eating in
reliefs in order that there might be no cessation of fire. The hot
meals for the Infantry were prepared at their rolling kitchens a short
distance in rear of the line, and sent forward to them in "marmite"
cans.</p>

<p>The company was the unit on which the feeding of the men was
based. Each month the company was given credit at the quartermaster's
store equal to the number of men in the company multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>plied
by thirty times the ration allowance. On the basis of this credit
the mess sergeant of the company made purchases to feed his men.
He might be as economical as he desired, provided that he fed
the men sufficiently. If the entire credit extended him at the camp
quartermaster's office was not used up during the month, a check
was given for the difference. This went into the company's funds,
with which the mess sergeant might buy in the open market such
extras and delicacies as the savings would permit, up to the quantity
specified in the ration.</p>

<p>But this system was followed only in the United States. Savings
were not allowed in France, all food there being issued on a straight
ration basis. This was due to the fact that the shortage of tonnage
made it imperative that no article not absolutely essential be shipped
from the United States, while difficulties of transportation in France
necessarily eliminated all except the most essential articles of food.</p>

<p>Under the procedure in vogue previous to the recent war, subsistence
was purchased by depot quartermasters located in 13 principal
cities throughout the United States. The plan gave the Army a
large number of purchasing officers for subsistence, working without
coordination and even in active competition with each other. This
condition resulted in a wide range of prices and a lack of uniform
quality; while under war conditions, with the enormous quantities
to be procured, it would cause at times a congestion of buying orders,
with consequent disturbance of market prices.</p>

<p>A plan of control was soon worked out whereby the Subsistence
Division, with headquarters at Washington, received at regular intervals
the estimates of the needs for subsistence for the Army, both at
home and abroad. These estimates were compared and a budget
made up. Bids were then asked through zone supply officers, who
reported the bids to the control body in Washington. The lowest
or most advantageous bid was accepted, and the purchase was completed
by the zone supply officer in whose zone the seller was located.
The plan eliminated one army zone bidding against another. At
the same time it enabled every manufacturer or producer to bid on
the needs of the Army. In this way active competition was secured
and low prices obtained. A decided advantage of the plan was that
purchases were made with a minimum of disturbance to prices paid
by the civilian trade.</p>

<p>Not only was it necessary to coordinate army organizations, but
it was also found that the independent buying of the Army, the
Navy, and the Allied Provision Export Commission was having the
effect of increasing prices of a number of food products. These buying
agencies were unconsciously bidding against each other. In
December, 1917, at the suggestion of the Food Administrator, with
the consent and approval of the Secretary of War and of the Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
of the Navy, the food purchase board was organized to coordinate
all of the purchases of food products in this country intended for
military purposes. The plan adopted was to allot through the Food
Administration the required quantity to the industry producing the
commodity in question, dividing the business among the various
producers in proportion to their capacity. Products so controlled
were those in which there was an actual or prospective shortage.
The prices were determined by the food purchase board after studying
and investigating the costs of production. The products so
purchased included flour, sugar, all canned vegetables, canned and
evaporated fruits, salmon, sardines, canned milk, rice, and, for a
time, fresh beef. These products totaled about 40 per cent of all
food requirements for the Army.</p>

<p>Practically all purchasing of meat was done by the Subsistence
Division's packing-house branch, located in Chicago. Circular proposals
were submitted by the various packers whose headquarters are
located there. The Subsistence Division ordered the required purchases
made, and the Chicago office at once allotted the amount
needed among the packers. After the butchering and inspection of
the meat, it was sent to the freezers and, after being frozen, was
loaded in the cars and shipped to the embarkation points. The
whole process from the time the animal was killed until it was loaded
on the boat took about two weeks.</p>

<p>The Middle West produced practically all the beef which nourished
our fighting men. Some of the cattle were bought in California, inspected
at the packing-house plants along the Pacific coast, and sent
to France via the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>The packers of Chicago and other cities found their plants, gigantic
as they were, all too small to handle the demand of our troops for
meat products packed in special forms; and extensive additions,
both in buildings and machinery, were required by the Army's
demands.</p>

<p>It was only by careful vigilance on the part of its inspection branch
that the millions of men dependent on the Subsistence Division for
their food were protected from deterioration of supplies and abuses
by certain dealers and manufacturers. Such firms were in the
minority, for the food industry backed the Army with great loyalty,
giving honest and patriotic support. In a certain week the inspection
service found oatmeal flour moldy and unfit for use, having been
stored too long before using; large amounts of potatoes, shipped to
Camp Devens, undersize and frostbitten; 3,000 pounds of butter at
Camp Greene too old for use; and 12 carloads of tomatoes of poor
quality. The system in vogue of demanding reinspection was responsible
for discovering many such cases, and traveling inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
also kept the products up to the highest standard. Any information
from outside sources was immediately investigated.</p>

<p>Samples of all shipments of food stuffs were required to be sent
to the inspection branch. In this way many violations of the food
laws were found. One packer was found to be using pork which
contained large numbers of skippers. Another tried, consciously or
unconsciously, to pass off wormy dried fruits. Milk has in some
cases been found to be much below standard. All of these supplies
were promptly rejected as improper for Army use. In many cases
the fault has been found to be the result of improper manufacturing
conditions, and in this event the manufacturer has been compelled
to make good the loss to the Army. The general result of this inspection
was that manufacturers gave the Army their very best
products.</p>

<p>One of the most important divisions of the inspection branch was the
meat and meat-products section. Its function was the supervision of
the reinspection, storage, and handling of meat and meat products, butter,
and cheese. Special care was taken to see that there were no embalmed
meats. Meat and meat products, butter, and cheese are all
highly perishable articles; and, although they may be delivered in perfect
condition, many imperfections may develop if diligent care is not
exercised during shipment, handling, and storage. One of the first
steps taken at the camps was the installing of complete cold-storage
plants with adequate chill rooms, so that the proper preservation of
fresh meats was assured after arrival at camps. From the first the most
rigid inspection of meat and meat products was insisted on and no product
allowed to pass which did not comply with Army specifications.
The carcass might be from a perfectly healthy animal, yet be rejected,
as lightweight carcasses were not approved for consumption in the
Army. Instructions as to Army requirements were placed in the
hands of every inspector, covering the inspection, storage, and handling
of meat and dairy products. Supervisory traveling inspectors
visited all stations at irregular intervals to insure these instructions
being followed and to instruct quartermasters in posts which were
too small to warrant a qualified meat inspector being stationed there.</p>

<p>One object of the Subsistence Division was to educate the proper
officers throughout the Army to be inspectors. To accomplish this
the inspection branch compiled a manual covering practically all the
principal items of Army subsistence, the exact methods of inspection,
and how to detect imperfections in foods. Complete Army specifications
for all supplies were included. Gen. Pershing cabled for 250
copies to be used in France, and the University of California adopted
the manual to be used in zymology classes. It placed exact knowledge
in the hands of the men who received the food and who had the
responsibility that it be up to specifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The overseas forces were the particular concern of the Subsistence
Division. It was planned to have approximately three months'
advance supply of food sent over each month for the number of
troops actually sent to France during that month. This was
called the initial supply. In addition to this, there was sent over a
monthly automatic supply, equivalent to the amount of food the
troops already in France would consume during that month. In this
way a 90 days' reserve was usually maintained overseas.</p>

<p>The problems of the overseas forces demanded quick solution. The
new modes of warfare gave rise to many needs unknown in peace
times. The result was that calls came in for commodities which were
not at the time being produced in adequate quantities. Factories
had to be built, labor secured, and machinery manufactured; in instances
entirely new industries had to be created.</p>

<p>The Service of Supply found it was impossible to secure sufficient
fresh vegetables in Europe to take care of the requirements of our
troops, and the Subsistence Division at home was called upon to
supply dehydrated vegetables for overseas requirements. To send
fresh vegetables from the United States was impossible, due to the
great necessity for conserving ship tonnage, and a substitute was imperative.
To supply dehydrated vegetables meant the development
of an industry. Dehydration was practically unknown in the United
States, there being but three small plants in existence. The Subsistence
Division searched the country for advantageous locations
where there were prospects of having such factories established.
Within a few months the cooperation of companies was secured and
factories were built whose combined output for the month of December,
1918, amounted to 6,000,000 pounds, there being 15 large plants
in the United States at that time. Up to the date of the signing of
the armistice 62,000,000 pounds of dehydrated vegetables had been
ordered by Gen. Pershing.</p>

<p>The difficulty of supply was increased by the delicate process
which is required to make dehydrated vegetables. The moisture of
the fresh product must be removed without extracting the nutritious
juices or destroying the food value or flavor. After the vegetables
have been peeled and sliced or cubed, they are blanched, in order that
they may retain their starch components. They are then placed on
trays in huge kilns, through which heated air is blown until only the
small required amount of moisture is retained. The product is then
packed in hermetically sealed cans.</p>

<p>Dehydrated vegetables occupied a prominent place in the soldier's
menu in France. Reports from overseas made by inspectors of the
Subsistence Division indicate that dehydrated vegetables were
quite satisfactory. The Surgeon General's Office has approved
their use. However, when fresh vegetables could be purchased in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
foreign markets they were used in preference. The use of dehydrated
vegetables saved two-thirds of the cargo space in ships over
the amount required for fresh vegetables. Their use came at the
time when the cargo space was as valuable as life itself, and it enabled
men and munitions to be transported sooner than would otherwise
have been possible. Dehydrated vegetables were also found especially
adapted for use at the front when food was carried forward
from the rail heads to the trench kitchens under shell fire.</p>

<p>The emergency ration and its production make another interesting
story. Designed to be used only in dire extremity, primarily for
No Man's Land fighting, the ration was packed in small cans to be
carried in the soldier's pocket, usually the upper left-hand jacket
pocket. This ration corresponded to the starvation ration of the
allies. Its components were adopted after experiments at the
battle front and after consultations with food experts. It represented
the greatest amount of food that could be concentrated in the
smallest compass.</p>

<p>The complete ration consisted of three cakes of a mixture of beef
and ground cooked wheat, each cake weighing 3 ounces; three 1-ounce
cakes of chocolate; three-quarters of an ounce of fine salt;
and 1 dram of black pepper. From the beef the preparation process
removed all fat, sinew, and white fibrous tissue. The meat
was then heated, and all of its moisture was evaporated so skillfully
that no flavor was lost. The wheat or bread component of
the cake was prepared by removing the chaff from cooked wheat
which had been kiln-dried, parched, and then ground to a coarse
powder. The meat and bread were compounded together, about
two parts of bread to each part of meat, making a perfectly
homogeneous cake. The chocolate of the ration was prepared by
combining equal weights of fine chocolate, containing not less than
20 per cent of cocoa butter, and pure sugar, and molding the product
into cakes weighing 1 ounce each.</p>

<p>The several components were packed into oval tin cans, which
were camouflaged to render them inconspicuous. These cans bore
the legend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"U. S. Army Emergency Ration. Not to be opened
except by order of an officer, or in extremity."</p></div>

<p>Many ways of preparing the emergency ration for eating in the
field were found by experiments. The bread and meat cake could
be eaten dry; or, when boiled in 3 pints of water, it made a palatable
soup; boiled in 1 pint of water, it produced a thick porridge
which could be eaten hot or cold; the cold porridge could be sliced
and fried when circumstances permitted. The chocolate could be
eaten as candy or made into a drink by placing the chocolate in a
tin cup with hot water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>The gas attacks in the trenches made it necessary that the soldier's
food be packed in containers impervious to mustard gas poison,
mustard gas, when swallowed, attacking the intestines. The first call
for such a ration came during October, 1917, and it called for the
shipment of 100,000 sealed rations a month for 20 months. The
food was to be packed in hermetically sealed galvanized iron containers,
holding 25 rations each. The contents of each can consisted
of 25 pounds of meat in 1-pound cans, 25 pounds of hard bread in 8-ounce
cans, and 25 rations each of soluble coffee, sugar, and salt.
Tobacco and cigarettes were added for the comfort of the men. The
addition of tobacco and cigarettes was accidental. It was found necessary
at first to fill the surplus space in the containers with excelsior.
The office force of a large corporation learned of this fact and got permission
to fill the empty space in some of the containers with tobacco.
The Subsistence Division thought so well of the idea that orders were
issued for the tobacco ration to be placed in all reserve ration containers.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult elements in supplying the reserve ration
was the securing of tin cans for hard bread. These, because of their
unusual size and shape, could only be manufactured after new can-making
machines had been designed. The demand for such cans
exceeded 10,000,000 in number. Within a comparatively short time,
however, hard bread in cans for special reserve rations was being
produced on a large scale, and the overseas requirements were filled.</p>

<p>Next the manufacture of the necessary galvanized containers and
crates was contracted for. A packing plant was then designed to
pack the components into the containers, which was an intricate operation
in itself, the number of rations being so great. This plant was
so contrived that the parts of the packing material came in at one
end of the plant, and the hard bread, canned corned beef hash, canned
roast beef, and canned corned beef, canned fish, coffee, sugar, salt,
and can openers were packed into the galvanized containers as they
traveled on a conveyor belt, until all the components were included.</p>

<p>Only the best of Army purchases were put in the reserve ration.
A study was made of the best packers of the various commodities, and
their products were used exclusively. Everyone connected with the
packing knew the purpose of the ration. It was to be used only when
the trenches were under the heaviest fire&mdash;when hot food could not
be carried forward, and when the men were most in need of good food.
The reserve ration became the quality ration of the Army as a result.
After the packing was complete, the cans were hermetically sealed by
solder and camouflaged with olive drab paint. The container of the
ration, when packed, was so buoyant it would support two men upon
it when thrown into the sea, thus being a potential life raft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>It was also necessary to feed our men in German prison camps.
A ration for American prisoners was prepared by the Subsistence
Division of the Quartermaster Corps, in conjunction with the Food
and Nutrition Division of the Surgeon's General office. This ration
was distributed by the American Red Cross from Denmark and
Switzerland. Individual packages each containing sufficient food to
supply one man were sent to the prison camps each week. The chief
components of the package were corned beef and salmon (with an
occasional substitution of corned beef hash and canned roast beef),
hard dry bread, dry beans, rice, baked beans, and fresh potatoes
(where possible). Prunes, jam, apples, peaches, coffee, sugar, evaporated
milk, vinegar, salt, pepper, and pickles were also supplied.
Potatoes and onions were procured when possible in Ireland, France,
and Italy. Otherwise dehydrated potatoes and onions were used.</p>

<p>Special food was sent for the invalid prisoners, this ration containing
potted chicken, crackers, concentrated soup, dehydrated spinach,
creamed oat meal, cornstarch pudding, sweet chocolate, extract of
beef, soluble coffee, etc. There were several substitutes for all items
mentioned, among the substitutes being dried eggs, potted veal, cheese,
peanut butter, dried apricots, honey, corn meal, gelatine, malted
milk powder, bouillon cubes, apples, oranges, lemons, cocoa, and tea.</p>

<p>When the American troops entered the trenches it was found
impracticable to use the ordinary roasted and ground coffee. Its
preparation required too much fire, the smoke of which made a target
for the enemy. Experiments were made with soluble coffee, looking
toward guaranteeing a warm stimulant in the trenches. It was
found necessary to give hot drinks to the men before they went over
the top or after they had undergone periods of exposure. The
British and French troops were supplied with brandy, wine, or rum
on such occasions. But issues of intoxicants to soldiers were contrary
to the American policy, and quantities of soluble coffee were
substituted. Solidified alcohol was supplied so that the coffee
could be served hot.</p>

<p>The soluble-coffee industry was in its infancy in the United States.
So great was the demand for soluble coffee from the overseas forces
that the calls were for over thirty times the prewar production. A
cablegram was received in October informing us that after January 1,
1919, the troops would require 25,000 pounds of coffee each day in
addition to the amounts packed in the trench rations, these latter
quantities alone amounting to 12,000 pounds daily. Allowance was
also made for possible sinkings of 5,000 pounds daily, making a
total of 42,000 pounds necessary to meet the daily requirements
of the American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>The entire American output of soluble coffee was taken over for
the Army, but this amounted to only 6,000 pounds daily. A number
of manufacturers of other food products were induced to turn their
entire plants into soluble-coffee factories. The greatest difficulty
was incurred in the securing of the necessary equipment for these
new plants. There was but one company in the entire United States
which made the revolving bronze drums essential to the manufacturing
process. This company ran its plant seven days a week, with
three shifts daily, to produce the necessary materials. The metals
which went into these drums were vital in the manufacture of other
munitions, but it was even more important that men in the front
lines be given hot drinks when tired and worn from long fighting
and exposure.</p>

<p>The signing of the armistice saw the difficulties of supplying soluble
coffee about overcome. The Subsistence Division had won one
of its hardest fights. The cooperation of American manufacturers
had made the achievement possible.</p>

<p>The problem of supplying good coffee to the troops was a difficult
one. To make good coffee for a unit as large as a company is not
easy for the average cook. To guarantee that good coffee would
always be available, the Subsistence Division made one of its most
radical changes in handling supplies. This change was so complete
that whereas the Army formerly was served with coffee from three
to six months out of the roasters, it came to be supplied with coffee
freshly roasted every day.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war coffee was purchased, ready roasted
and ground, from competitive dealers. It was then held in New York
for about 30 days before being shipped overseas, the transportation
requiring 30 days more. Received in France, the coffee often was kept
for 90 days before it was distributed to the troops. In addition, a 30
days' supply must be kept on hand, making the coffee 6 months old
by the time it was used. The result was that when the coffee finally
reached the men it had lost half of its value as a stimulant and was
greatly deteriorated in flavor, often being in a crumbly condition.
"Muddy" coffee on the mess tables resulted.</p>

<p>The only way for the troops to secure fresh coffee was for us to send
over the green product for roasting as it was needed. Buildings were
erected to house coffee-roasting machinery at home and abroad;
men were trained as quickly as possible in the process of coffee-roasting,
and sent out to take charge of the plants. In a relatively
short length of time 16 plants were in full operation in France, and an
increasing number at home. Eventually all the coffee used in France
was shipped over green and roasted in the plants there. These plants
were capable of roasting sufficient coffee to take care of 3,000,000
men at a considerably lower cost to the Government than under the
old system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>The Expeditionary Forces, as is noted elsewhere, organised a
purchasing office in Paris. Its purpose was to save tonnage space by
securing as many products as possible in Europe. Its scope covered
all classes of supplies, but a large section was devoted to subsistence.
Candy, hard bread, and macaroni factories under the direction of the
Quartermaster Corps were built or secured from the French Government.
Large quantities of beans, fresh potatoes, onions, coffee, rice,
salt, and vinegar were secured from European markets. Many
thousands of tons of foodstuffs were purchased and manufactured in
Europe for our Army, every ton representing space on ships saved for
additional men and munitions. Overseas purchases were generally
discontinued after the signing of the armistice, as the Director of
Purchase and Storage and the Expeditionary Forces were firm for
the policy of favoring American manufacturers wherever possible.</p>

<p>To reduce tonnage still further, extensive experiments were made in
the packing of beef for overseas consumption. All bones, surplus
fats, and waste portions were removed. The remainder, all edible,
was pressed into 100-pound moulds and frozen. The initial shipment
was composed of 16 carloads of boneless beef. The meat
arrived in France in splendid condition, and was carefully watched
from its arrival at the ports in France to its consumption in the front-line
trenches. Officers, mess sergeants, and cooks were enthusiastic
over the boneless beef, as it took much less time to prepare it and so
conserved labor to a great extent. The men were gratified, as
the inferior portions of the beef were not included, and much better
meat resulted for the mess. After the success of this experimental
shipment, as much boneless beef as possible was sent to France.
Trouble was encountered in securing the skilled butchers to bone the
great quantities needed, but this shortage was largely overcome.</p>

<p>No means was discovered so effective for reducing tonnage as
boning beef, dehydrating vegetables, and purchasing foods in France,
but in many of the smaller items there were stories just as interesting.
Efforts to save tonnage brought about the reduction of
moisture in soap. While the Subsistence Division was securing
toilet paper it found that the entire supply for the Expeditionary
Forces could be stored in the waste space of Army rolling field kitchens.
A special formula for vinegar was devised, and double-strength vinegar
was shipped. This, when mixed with an equal quantity of water in
France, was a good product.</p>

<p>The saving of space in the transportation of subsistence stores
makes a long story in itself. Just so much tonnage was allotted to
food each month; and the ablest men in the food industry spent much
time in working out how the maximum amount of essentials and
luxuries in foodstuffs could be sent in the minimum amount of space.</p>

<p>The Subsistence Division not only looked after the working fighter
but the playing fighter as well. The American soldier is fond of
candy, tobacco, and chewing gum. The supply of these commodities
brought much pleasure to the troops. Long lines of men waiting for
free candy and tobacco in France, men who just came from the front,
formed one of the interesting sights of the war. Tobacco has established
its claim to a recognized place in the soldier's life. Probably 95
per cent of the soldiers of the American Expeditionary Forces used it
in one form or another. In May of 1918 it was decided to adopt the
practice of the allies, namely, to allow each soldier a certain amount of
tobacco per day. This unusual innovation was the official recognition
of tobacco as a necessity for men in active service. To men enduring
physical hardships, obliged to live without the comforts and often
even the necessities of life in times of battle, tobacco fills a need
nothing else can satisfy. The daily ration of four-tenths of an ounce
was given to every man overseas who desired it. The soldier had the
choice of cigarettes, smoking tobacco, or chewing tobacco. If he chose
smoking tobacco he received cigarette papers with it. In addition
the men could buy at any Army or other canteen the most popular
brands of cigars and cigarettes in unlimited quantities.</p>

<p>The Subsistence Division purchased for overseas shipment a
monthly average of 20,000,000 cigars and 425,000,000 cigarettes.
Abundant supplies of tobacco were on hand in the commissaries
overseas, and the soldier could buy it at actual cost. There was no
profit or tax added on any tobacco shipped to France, and it was sold
at retail to the troops at a cost lower than the price paid by the biggest
wholesalers in the United States. The plan for the purchase of cigars
and cigarettes was to divide the contracts among the most popular
brands in the same proportions as the latter are sold in this country.</p>

<p>Candy in the days of the old Army was considered a luxury. The
war with Germany witnessed a change. The old popularity of
chewing tobacco waned; that of candy increased. Approximately
300,000 pounds of candy represented the monthly purchases during the
early period of the war. This amount included both the home and
overseas consumption. Demands from overseas grew steadily. The
soldier far from home and from his customary amusements could not be
considered an ordinary individual living according to his own
inclinations, and candy became more and more sought after. As the
demand increased, the Quartermaster Department came to recognize
the need of systematic selection and purchase.</p>

<p>The first purchases were made from offerings of manufacturers
without any particular standard, 40 per cent being assorted chocolates,
30 per cent assorted stick candy, and 30 per cent lemon drops. A
standard was developed through the steady work of confectionery
experts. This standard offered no opportunities for deception, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
guaranteed candy made from pure sugar and the best of other
materials. The specifications furnished all bidders covered raw materials,
the methods of manufacture, packing, and casing. Specifications
were adopted after many conferences with the leading manufacturers
of the country. These men cooperated in the work by giving their
best suggestions and often their trade secrets.</p>

<p>Huge purchases of candy were made during the days when sugar
was scarcest in the United States. The Food Administration was
convinced that the Army should have all the candy it desired, and
sufficient quantities of sugar were allotted for the purpose. From
300,000 pounds monthly the candy purchases increased till they
equaled 1,373,300 pounds in November, 1918, the highest amount
purchased up to that time. In December, 1918, an innovation was
adopted, consisting of giving the troops a regular monthly ration of
candy. The candy which had been shipped every month for sale in the
various canteens had always been quickly disposed of. Many men
did not get the opportunity to make purchases. The ration plan,
however, assured each man a pound and a half a month, without
exception. It required 3,495,000 pounds the first month of the
ration system to provide each soldier overseas with his allotted
portion.</p>

<p>In December, 1918, the Subsistence Division took over the purchase
of all candy for the various organizations conducting canteens
for our troops. The purchase for that month totaled 10,137,000
pounds, all of which was shipped overseas. It was the largest
exportation of candy on record. The candy purchased for the
canteens, commissaries, and other agencies was manufactured by
the best known candy firms in the country. A portion of the candy
consumed overseas was manufactured in France. This French
supply was discontinued January 15, 1919, and thereafter all requirements
were shipped over from the United States. The candy was
sold to the men at just half the price it would have cost individuals
here. After December, 1918, 50,000 pounds were furnished each
month for sales purposes for every 25,000 men in France. Up to
February 1, 1919, 21,000,000 pounds of candy had been sent across.
The demand for candy jumped skyward after the signing of the
armistice, the men then having more time on their hands in which
to enjoy luxuries. Tobacco demands likewise increased.</p>

<p>The suffering sweet tooth of the Yank was not appeased by candy
alone. The third of a billion pounds of sugar bought for the Army
represents a tremendous number of cakes, tarts, pies, and custards.
An old soldier recently stated that the ice cream eaten by the Army
during the war would start a new ocean. The serious shortage of
sugar which at one time threatened to reduce sweets to an irreducible
minimum on the civilian bill of fare did not interfere with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
soldier's ration, which continued to be 6 pounds monthly in this
country and about 9 pounds overseas. The ration for the civilian
population was reduced to 2 pounds monthly. Army officers were
placed on the same status as the civilian population and were
allowed to purchase only the amount stipulated for civilians for use
in their homes.</p>

<p>Up to the signing of the armistice the total amount of granulated,
cut, and powdered sugar purchased by the Subsistence Division
equaled 342,745,862 pounds and cost $28,465,050. Of this amount
the greater portion was shipped to the troops in France.</p>

<p>A close companion in popularity to candy and tobacco was the
typical American product, chewing gum. This confection was
found of great value on the march as a substitute for water. Its
importance is shown in the vast amount sent overseas. A total
of 3,500,000 packages represents the overseas shipment in January,
1919. The shipment for February was 3,200,000 packages. The
winter consumption of gum was heavier than that of summer, the
average monthly supply being only 1,500,000 packages during the
summer of 1918. Chewing gum came to be considered a necessity
by the men in France and has been found to be an invaluable aid
to keeping up their spirits in the midst of hardships.</p>

<p>Every complaint against meals served in the Army reaching the
attention of the Subsistence Division was investigated. These
investigations were made in conjunction with the Inspector General's
Department of the Army. Where complaints were justified,
remedial action was taken. A study of the complaints revealed
that most dissatisfaction was among new troops who, when first
separated from the luxuries of home, wrote of their adventures at
the mess table, enlarging any lack of home comforts into stories of
privation. The more solid food, however, soon became popular, as
the hard work in training gave an appetite for sustaining rather
than for the more fancy foods.</p>

<p>Subsistence to the value of $327,060,097 was shipped to our forces
overseas from the United States from the start of the war to December
1, 1918. The following table gives the quantity, unit price, and total
value of these subsistence items:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

CLOTHING AND EQUIPAGE.</h3>


<p>The Army raised against Germany had to have stout shoes for its
feet. It required warm uniforms and overcoats and good socks and
underwear. It had to have heavy blankets for its beds. The men
needed raincoats and rubber boots for wet and muddy weather.
Tentage was required, pup tents for the front and large tents and
flies at the camps. Belts and bandoleers of cotton webbing added to
the soldier's efficiency as a rifleman or machine gunner.</p>

<p>To procure these and other supplies for an American Army that
eventually reached the strength of 3,750,000 men required the best
brains in the textile, rubber fabric, and leather goods industries.
From the counting rooms, from the laboratories, and from the American
factories the needs of the Government called to Washington
several hundred men, experts in a thousand lines, and put them
into American officers' uniforms. Eventually the various agencies
of the War Department purchasing these supplies were centralized
in a single division known as the Clothing and Equipage Division of
the Office of the Director of Purchase and Storage, which in turn was
part of the Division of Purchase, Storage, and Traffic.</p>

<p>The total cost of this necessary equipment of textiles and leather
and rubber goods was approximately $2,100,000,000. Of the
enormous sum of money appropriated for the so-called quartermaster
activities, a full one-quarter went for clothing and equipage of this
sort.</p>

<p>The group who handled this enormous manufacturing effort not
only conducted one of the biggest undertakings of the war but did
it in a way to command the admiration of those who knew the
story of what was going on. The division turned scientific attention,
and that means the attention of real scientists, to the proper
construction of all sorts of articles. It designed new styles of soldiers'
clothing adapted in every curve and line to the service in France.
It standardized dyes and made studies of protective coloring. It
produced highly specialized shoes. It saved millions of dollars by
the scientific study of specifications of various articles. It educated
manufacturers in the production of articles strange to their experience,
and in some cases developed entirely new industries. At one
time it constituted the entire wool trade of the United States, since
it had optioned every pound of wool in sight and had its agents out
gathering up the excess wool of the earth. It was a shipmaster, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
employer of men, a reformer in labor conditions, and an inventor
and originator of new products.</p>

<p>The organization was important not only for the size of its business
but because it dealt more intimately with the individual soldier than
perhaps any other production branch of the Government, with the
possible exception of the branch which fed him. It might seem to
be a fairly easy proposition to buy clothing for a soldier, his tent, and
the bed clothing that kept him warm in active service or when he
was a patient in a military hospital. But it was not a simple task.
None of these articles was standard for civilian use, either in material,
color, or pattern. Everything had to be made to order. The
ordinary factory could not begin work on contracts for these supplies
on a minute's notice, but usually only after special and sometimes
costly preparation.</p>

<p>And as the Army grew in size it had to have large quantities of
special clothing. Cooks needed cotton aprons, and blacksmiths
leather ones. Linemen had to have special gloves; hospital orderlies
and waiters at messes required white duck suits; motorcyclists needed
hoods; laborers, overalls; and firemen, helmets. There were special
garments for aviators. We began capturing prisoners and they
had to have special uniforms. Convalescents at hospitals needed
special suits. The women nurses of the Army were supplied with
uniforms, something entirely outside of previous Army experience.</p>

<p>The Government was something more than the designer and
manufacturer of these goods, drawing the specifications, placing
the orders, and then teaching the processes of manufacture in the
thousands of factories which had virtually become Government
plants. The clothing and equipage organization had to go further
back and become the actual procurer of the raw materials; and this
phase of its work eventually became one of the largest and most
spectacular and romantic elements of the whole undertaking. In
addition to procuring the raw cotton and the raw wool and the
hides, the Government had to go into the manufacture of cloth and
the tanning of leather to supply these commodities to the manufacturers
of the finished articles. The Government went into a raw
materials market which was already glutted with orders from the
allied governments and from domestic consumption. It went into
this market at first without money, since funds on the scale demanded
were not available between March 4, 1917, and June 15 of the same
year; and it had to buy on credit and secure the commodities in the
face of cash bidding for them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the whole enormous undertaking was successfully
carried through. Except in rare instances, the American soldier
never lacked for necessary supplies of this character. The organization
which handled the work originally consisted of 6 officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
25 clerks. When the armistice was signed this great purchasing
and manufacturing agency had an enrollment of 1,693 people.</p>

<p>Wool was the most important of the raw materials to be procured,
since wool entered into the composition of more items than any
other material. Uniforms, overcoats, underwear, socks, breeches,
shirts, and many other articles had to be made entirely or partially
of wool. The purchases of woolen breeches alone during the war
period amounted to 13,176,000 pairs. On September 10, 1918, the
wool experts of the army estimated the Nation's total needs for wool
up to June 30, 1919. The War Department, it was found, during
this time would require 246,000,000 pounds of clean wool; the allotment
to civilian needs was but 15,000,000 pounds. In other words,
the war demands were to absorb practically the entire supply of
wool; civilians were to be forced to do without it almost entirely.</p>

<p>Soon after the declaration of war the Quartermaster Corps estimated
that it would require about 100,000,000 pounds of scoured wool
to meet the initial demands of the Army in 1917. A meeting was
called of the principal wool dealers of the United States, most of
them from Boston, and a quick inventory was taken of the available
wool supplies, not only in the United States, but on order from
foreign countries. It was found that there was in sight 78,000,000
pounds of greasy wool, which, after being scoured, would produce
35,000,000 pounds of wool of the quality needed. This was barely
one-third of the Army's demand alone. It should be noted,
however, that this inventory was taken just before the annual
American clip, which would be finished by the end of July.</p>

<p>To insure that the Government would secure every pound of wool
in sight, options were promptly obtained on all wool in American
warehouses or on the sea, and speculation in the prices of the domestic
clip for 1917 was thus headed off by the entry of the Government
itself in the raw wool business. The prices were fixed for the
1917 clip as of July 31. A year later the clothing and equipage
division had become the entire wool trade of the United States.
There was no wool market again and no public sale of wool until after
the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>To handle this enormous undertaking the division appointed a
wool administrator to buy wool, a wool purchasing quartermaster
to pay for it, and a wool distributor to sell it to the Government
contractors. The Government's wool headquarters was in Boston,
with branches at Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco,
and Seattle. This organization arranged to procure the whole 1917
clip, if needed, took over all wool destined for the United States
under import licenses, and sent its agents to foreign markets.</p>

<p>The largest of the foreign markets practically available from the
standpoint of distance was the Argentine in South America. Aus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>tralia
and New Zealand were, of course, enormous markets, but the
dearth of shipping made it impossible to spare many bottoms for
the long voyage into the Antipodes. As a matter of fact, when the
fighting ceased, the whole world was suffering for wool, except Australia
and New Zealand. America was short of wool, France had
practically none, there was a little in England, but Australia and
New Zealand had the staggering surplus of 1,000,000,000 pounds.
This was due to the fact that there had been no shipping available
to bring this wool to America or Europe.</p>

<p>The Government's wool administrator secured such Australian
and New Zealand wool as he could; but he had to rely principally on
sailing vessels, which could not, under the most favorable conditions,
go to Australia and back again in less than seven months, while
nine or ten months were more often required. A quick sailing voyage
to Argentina and back required five months.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, and this was particularly true in the early fall of
1918, when preparations were being made for the equipment of the
Army in 1919, every effort was made to secure foreign wool. A
South American wool-buying commission was formed and sent to
Buenos Aires, arriving there October 30, 1918. By that time, however,
the end of the war was in sight, and the commission never
opened up its Argentine headquarters.</p>

<p>The Government conducted its raw-wool business on the lines of a
great department store. Headquarters were established in Boston,
where the wool distributors kept samples of almost every kind of
wool produced on earth, these samples representing stocks on hand
in the various Government warehouses in Boston and elsewhere.
Charles J. Nichols, a member of a large Boston wool firm, was the
wool administrator and E. W. Brigham was wool distributor.
Prices were fixed, and the manufacturers bought from the samples.
Carpet wool was sold at an office in Philadelphia. The wool administrator
did a business that averaged $2,500,000 per day during his
incumbency, his total purchases amounting to about 722,000,000
pounds of wool.</p>

<p>At first the supply of the better grades of wool seemed to be adequate
to meet the Army's demands. Later, however, changes were
made in the specifications for various cloths, uniform cloth being increased
from 16 to 20 ounces in weight, overcoating from 30 to 32
ounces, shirting flannel from 8&frac12; to 9&frac12; ounces, and blankets from 3
to 4 pounds. These increases made it necessary for the Army to
use grades of wool previously made only into coarse materials like
carpet. The lower grades of wool were blended with the finer grades
to provide the necessary weight and warmth, even at the expense of
fineness of texture and appearance. This action explains why at the
end of the period of hostilities some of the American soldiers' uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>forms
looked rough and uneven in color. But the necessary cloth
was provided, and it was warm.</p>

<p>The Government saved every ounce of wool that it possibly could
save. More economical patterns and layouts for the cutting of
uniforms were designed in Washington and furnished to the manufacturers.
The American soldier's uniform did not meet the approval
of officers of the American Expeditionary Forces as to style, after
the latter had become used to seeing the smartly dressed troops of
Europe. Accordingly, after Gen. Pershing had recommended a
better-appearing uniform, a new one was designed, incidentally with
an eye to saving cloth. The coat of the uniform&mdash;formerly called
the blouse, a designation which is now obsolete&mdash;was cut with new
lines, making it slimmer without sacrifice of warmth or comfort.
The patch pockets of the original blouse were usually unsightly
bulges when the soldiers filled them with articles. On the new coat
the patch pocket was retained only in appearance, the pocket actually
being on the inside.</p>

<p>It is not known to most Americans that the breeches, which have
been typical of the American service uniform for many years, were
abandoned late in the war in favor of long trousers. This change
was also due to studies made by the army clothing experts. The
soldiers themselves were not enamored of breeches, since they had to
be either laced or buttoned below the knee, a process which took
time always, but seemed to take more when a man was in a hurry.
The laces sometimes chafed the leg under the leggins. Then, too,
it was often impossible to remove the breeches from soldiers wounded
in their legs without cutting the cloth. Long trousers did away with
all these objections and had the added virtue of being warmer than
the breeches.</p>

<p>The overcoat, too, was redesigned, following Gen. Pershing's
recommendations, the stock overcoat being too long to be worn in
the trenches. A knee-length garment was provided which was much
smarter than the older coat.</p>

<p>The redesigning of the overcoat and the uniform (although the
new uniform never appeared in the field) accomplished numerous
economies. Merely by the elimination of lacings, eyelets, tape, and
stays, the new trousers cost 95.25 cents less than a pair of army
breeches. By July 1, 1919, this change in design would have saved
the Government $16,988,440 in orders for trousers already placed or
in sight. The change in overcoat styles saved 62 cents per garment,
or a total saving to July 1, 1919, estimated at $897,140. The service
coat, made by redesigning the blouse, saved the Government $1.598
on each garment, or an estimated saving of $4,977,770 to July 1, 1919.</p>

<p>This was not only financial saving, but what was more important,
it was saving the consumption of the raw material, wool. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
Government could always raise more money; but if the wool supply
were exhausted, all the money on earth could not buy any more of it.</p>

<p>A more economical cutting pattern saved twenty-three one-hundredths
of a yard of cloth in the manufacture of every pair of
trousers. This resulted in the total saving of 2,300,000 yards of
woolen cloth. Part of the facings of the service coats and overcoats
were eliminated without sacrificing warmth or serviceability, and
cheaper cotton linings were substituted. Another important cloth
economy came when the Army designers cut off the right-hand
pocket of the O. D. shirt, on the ground that this pocket was seldom
used. The designers also substituted an oblong elbow patch on the
Army shirt for the circular patch formerly specified. This substitution
was not economy in cloth, but the original circular patch, put
on the sleeve to reinforce it at the point of greatest wear, actually
resulted in reducing or shortening the life of the garment by tearing
loose at the stitches, a fault which the oblong patch overcame.</p>

<p>In the earlier contracts the garment makers were stimulated to
save wool by being allowed a percentage of the cost of yardage saved.
Each contractor, too, was permitted to sell his own clippings. But
as the Government obtained a more scientific grasp of the clothing
problem and produced pattern layouts which utilized the maximum
percentages of the cloth, the issues of cloth to the garment makers
were calculated more closely. Thereafter the contractors received
no reimbursement for cloth savings, and the Government itself took
all the clippings.</p>

<p>These clippings were shipped to a base sorting plant at New York,
where they were baled and shipped out to mills to be used as reworked
wool in blankets and other articles. The clippings were sorted at a
cost of 1.7 cents per pound and sold at an average price of 23 cents
per pound, the total sales bringing in to the Government $5,500,000.</p>

<p>The history of the Government's wool enterprise during the war
illustrates how hard it was to check the momentum of the whole production
undertaking against Germany once it had attained full speed.
A week before the armistice was signed the wool stocks looked small,
and shortages plainly existed to cause anxiety for the executives in
Washington. That was because we were thinking in terms of consumption
made familiar by the terrific destruction of war. A week
later the same stocks looked overwhelming in size, and the shortages
had become enormous surpluses. It had been a constant worry to
procure a sufficient quantity of blankets, yet as soon as the armistice
was signed, we had on hand a 47-months' supply of blankets for
1,000,000 men in the United States and 2,400,000 men overseas.
As soon as the German plenipotentiaries affixed their signatures to
the armistice agreement at Spa an apparently small stock of marching
shoes turned into a 4-year supply for 3,400,000 soldiers at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
and abroad. On November 1, 1918, the Clothing and Equipage
Division had on hand a reserve stock of goods valued at $811,000,000.</p>

<p>The entire woolen industry, from the handlers of raw wool to the
textile mills, worked splendidly with the Government. At all times
there was plenty of available machinery to make all the cloth for
which wool could be furnished. Mills which found no Government
use for their regular business output went heartily to work to make
something else that the Government would need. The Government's
uses for carpet, for instance, were practically negligible; so that the
carpet mills, many of them, swung their entire production to Army
blankets and Army duck.</p>

<p>Blankets, in fact, were one of the largest items. The total purchases
brought to the Government warehouses about 22,000,000 blankets, at
a total cost of over $145,000,000. Melton cloth for overcoats and
uniforms consumed an enormous quantity of wool. The total purchases
of melton amounted to more than 100,000,000 yards, or enough
to stretch twice around the world at the Equator, with a strip left
over long enough to reach from New York across Germany and Russia
and into Siberia. The total quantity of raw wool bought by the
Government up to December 14, 1918, cost over $504,000,000.</p>

<p>After the Government had secured the wool and various types of
cloth, there still remained the task of making this cloth into uniforms.
The usual method was for the Government to furnish the materials
and to pay the contractor his cost of manufacturing.</p>

<p>All Army clothing was made up according to the so-called tariff
sizes. The average coat for a man is a 38 or 40, and experience shows
how many men in a given number will need this average. But there
were always exceptions. One camp sent in a special order for 46
overcoats for "fats."</p>

<p>Through a scientific study of the problem, notable reforms in the
matter of fitting soldiers were brought about. When the men were
coming in greatest numbers from civilian life to the training camps
they were often put to great inconvenience in securing proper clothing.
Each man would ask for such sizes as he thought were correct,
but it often happened that the garments supplied to him did not fit
him, and he thereafter spent some hours or even days swapping garments
with other recruits until he eventually acquired an outfit
somewhere near his size. Then, too, there was confusion in the way
the articles were supplied to the men, who sometimes had to stand
in line all day long, awaiting their turn at the issue windows.</p>

<p>The matter of fitting was satisfactorily solved by adopting the so-called
foolproof size labels. The labels originally used were merely
paper tags pinned to the garments, and in the handling of garments
by men unfamiliar with the fitting of ready-made clothing mistakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
often resulted. As in the case of civilian clothing, all Army clothing
was divided into four classes, known as "longs," "shorts," "stouts,"
and "regulars." A garment of any size would come in these four
classes. The labels were marked with diagonal, colored stripes to
indicate the general characteristics of the garment to which it was
attached. Thus green meant a "short," red indicated a "long," and
yellow showed the garment to be a "stout." The soldier was pretty
sure to remember the color of the stripe attached to the garment
that fitted him. If he were a green striper, he would refuse to accept
anything that did not bear a green stripe on its ticket.</p>

<p>Before hostilities ceased a system providing a more scientific
issue of clothing to recruits had been introduced. Under this system
the recruit would enter the supply building at one end and there,
in a special room, strip himself of his civilian clothing. He would
thereupon enter the mill as naked as the Lord made him. He
would stop first at the underwear counter, where he would procure
garments that fitted him, would don them, and then pass on to the
hosiery counter. Thus he would progress down the line, eventually
emerging from the other end of the building a fully dressed American
soldier, the process reminding one of the progress of an automobile
through the Ford factory.</p>

<p>It required the services of some 4,000 inspectors to supervise the
garment-making in thousands of shops scattered throughout the
country. This inspection also looked at the character of the shops
taking contracts, and the Government was sometimes hard put to
it to prevent child labor and sweat shop production in the work.</p>

<p>At one time there came a rush order from France to supply several
hundred thousand mackinaws. An officer who was familiar with,
mackinaws was sent out from Washington to buy them from goods
in stock. He accomplished his mission in 10 days, literally baring
the shelves of the United States of these garments, his purchases
including the extensive quantities of mackinaws held by mail-order
houses in Chicago.</p>

<p>It was always a problem in clothing the Army to find olive-drab
dyes that were fast in color. The first dyes used were apt to fade
quickly. A certain dye was of the proper color, yet it was found on
test to have the peculiar characteristic of being visible at a distance.
As the new American synthetic dye industry expanded and processes
were perfected, the officers of the Clothing and Equipage Division
were able to cooperate with the American dye makers to produce
satisfactory dyes.</p>

<p>Yet while the olive-drab dye used in dyeing coats and trousers
seemed to withstand the sun and rain, that used in coloring the leggins
proved to be fugitive to a remarkable degree. It seemed to be
impossible to produce a dye that would hold its shade in leggins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
The experts working on the dye problem had expended a good deal
of valuable energy in worry and had grown a few gray hairs in their
heads over the failure of leggin dyes when they discovered the true
cause of the fading. The men were deliberately bleaching out their
leggins, usually by using salt solutions on them, since anything
but a faded leggin indicated that the soldier who wore it was a rookie
and a greenhorn.</p>

<p>The materials which went into the manufacture of clothing came
from various sections of the country, since the several garment
industries had grown up around centers. For instance, the melton
cloth came generally from the Boston district. Linings were supplied
from Atlanta, buttons from Philadelphia, and duck from Chicago.
This geographic distribution of supplies simplified the Government's
problem of supplying materials to the various contractors.
It was possible to supply materials on short notice to any
garment-making district.</p>

<p>At one time Chicago wired that unless 500,000 yards of flannel
shirting were supplied immediately hundreds of shirt factories in
Chicago and the Chicago district would have to close down. Accordingly,
a special freight train was loaded with shirting in the East
and started for Chicago on a special movement in charge of a "live
tracer"&mdash;that is, an officer who saw that the train was put through
to its destination. The train arrived in Chicago on the second day
after the order was received, so rapidly had the goods been procured
and loaded.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular uniforms for the men, almost half a
million articles of clothing for officers were also bought by the Government.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster Department went into an entirely new field
when it bought uniforms for the women nurses of the Army. There
was a Norfolk suit which cost about $30 and a cotton uniform that
cost about $3, an overcoat costing nearly $28, and then there were
waists made from navy blue silk and from white cotton, and hats.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of clothing, it is interesting to refer
again to the clothing furnished for interned prisoners. This was
not manufactured for the purpose. Uniforms discarded by our own
men were reclaimed and dyed a special shade of green. Over 50,000
of these garments were prepared at an average cost of less than 30
cents per garment. It had been the original intention to make a
special prisoner's uniform striped in resemblance to the prison
suits worn in American penitentiaries.</p>

<p>Another interesting development in the manufacture of Army
clothing was the production of a special uniform for expeditionary
troops sent to Russia. The uniforms were so warm that they could
well serve as the equipment for an Arctic exploration party. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
determination to send an expedition to Russia was made suddenly
by the Government, and the decision brought with it the problem of
producing in a jiffy an equipment of garments not only expensive
in themselves, but of a character unknown to the American garment
trade. An agent for the division in New York at once bought on
the New York market large quantities of muskrat, wolf, and marmot
fur. Other agents were sent into our own Northwest and to Canada
to pick up such suitable garments as these markets afforded. The
Siberian equipment as specified by the commanders of the expedition
called for fur caps, fur mittens and fur overcoats, mucklucks, moccasins,
felt shoes, fur parkas, and underwear for 15,000 men or more.
The order for the equipment came in the latter part of August,
1918, so that only the fastest kind of work would produce the garments
in time to catch the last steamer that could get into the northern
Russian and Siberian ports before the ice closed navigation for
the season. The result was that whenever the articles specified
could not be procured on time, suitable substitutes were provided.</p>

<p>The specifications called for 80 per cent wool underwear. Underwear
with that percentage of wool could not be provided, but underwear
of equal weight was substituted. Where fur-lined garments
were unobtainable, fur-trimmed ones were procured. The specifications
called for Buffalo coats. The division sent a man to the north
woods country of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and there in the supply
cities he bought sheep-lined coats with moleskin or duck shells as a
substitute. These coats were the sort used by woodsmen and Alaskan
miners and explorers. There was no time to procure mucklucks,
moccasins, and felt shoes, so an agent of the division was sent into
Canada to buy shoe pacs (or lumbermen's boots) and lumbermen's
knee-length socks. The total cost of the whole outfit was more than
$100 per man.</p>

<p>It was impossible to find any substitute for the Alaskan parka. A
parka is a sort of overshirt, wind proof and waterproof and hooded,
to be worn over the overcoat and cap of the uniform. Consequently
it was necessary to produce the parkas in this country, although
our garment makers were entirely unfamiliar with such manufacture.
The work was undertaken by the International Duplex Coat Co.,
at 114 Fifth Avenue, New York. It was necessary from the start in
turning out this order for the employees of this plant to work overtime.
In order to speed the production the principal member of
this firm himself took his place at the bench and worked almost day
and night in cutting out garments.</p>

<p>The day approached closer and closer when the shipment would
have to start across the country if it were to catch the last boat from
San Francisco. On the home stretch of the race the entire working
force of the plant went 36 hours, stopping only for meals. The last
stitch was taken at 1.30 o'clock in the morning. The garments were
then piled upon auto trucks to be rushed to the baling plant in
Brooklyn. One of the loaded trucks developed engine trouble and
stopped in the middle of a bridge across the East River. The officer in
charge thereupon commandeered every automobile that came along,
piled them all full of parkas and sent them to the baling plant. The
entire shipment was aboard the train less than one hour before its
starting time.</p>

<p>It was not only necessary for the Government to furnish cloth for
the uniforms, shirts, and other articles, but it had to supply the
fittings and findings as well, such needs as linings, tape, buttons, and
hooks and eyes. In the calendar year 1918 the purchases amounted to
over 46,000,000 yards of cotton lining and 2,500,000 yards of felt
lining, worth over $18,000,000. The Government spent over
$100,000 for hooks and eyes, $150,000 for tape, $1,250,000 for thread,
and practically $3,000,000 for buttons.</p>

<p>When it was found that the standard specifications for Army
uniform buttons favored a certain class of manufacturers and excluded
many others, new specifications were drawn so as to make it possible
for every button manufacturer in the country to compete for contracts.
An exclusive study was made of new materials for buttons.
They had been made of brass or bronze, but due to other war necessities
for metals an effort was made to provide a substitute. It was
found, too, that metal buttons sometimes resulted in infection of
wounds received on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Substitution of vegetable ivory for metal in buttons was attempted.
The Bureau of Standards in Washington tested the taqua, or ivory,
nuts from which buttons are made and found them suitable. A
vegetable ivory button with a shank was developed, although no
such ivory button had been known before, and the Government's
insignia was stamped on this button. Gen. Pershing approved the
use of ivory buttons, and thereafter many manufacturers produced
millions of gross of them. Every manufacturer who took button
contracts agreed to turn over the ivory nut waste to the Chemical
Warfare Service to be used in making charcoal for the gas-absorbing
canisters of the gas masks. Most of the buttons were produced by
firms in Rochester and Philadelphia. Many concerns made them
who had never made buttons before. Manufacturers of electric
goods, hardware, billiard balls, celluloid, pearl buttons, and phonograph
records turned their plants into ivory-button factories. Enormous
quantities of buttons were required. For the Army shirts alone
the Government needed 216,000,000 buttons in 1918.</p>

<p>Flags constituted another class of goods requiring wool. In all, the
division produced 40,000 flags during the war period, most of these
being made at the Government's own shop at Philadelphia. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
grim fact that many of these flags were used to wrap around the
bodies of soldiers who died at sea. Thirty million chevrons for noncommissioned
officers were also turned out by the Government.</p>

<p>The production of overseas caps for the American Expeditionary
Forces was likewise an extensive undertaking. When the requisition
for overseas caps came from France, it was not possible to design one
here because of lack of knowledge of what was required. Later a
courier bearing a sample cap came to the United States from
Gen. Pershing. As soon as this sample was received a meeting of cap
makers was called in New York, and 100 manufacturers attended.
One and all agreed to turn over their factories to the exclusive production
of overseas caps until the requirements were met. It took
these cap makers only two weeks to turn out the first order. In all
4,972,000 caps were delivered.</p>

<p>Our experts on this side of the water were not satisfied with the
overseas cap. It shrank after being wet, it quickly lost shape, it
absorbed much water and did not dry out quickly, and it was unattractive
in appearance. Also it did not shade the eyes, and the
experience in France showed that the soldiers usually improvised
peaks to their caps by sticking their girls' letters between their caps
and their foreheads. Then, moreover, the standard cap was made of
20-ounce melton, which was a fabric hard to get. But there was
plenty of rabbit fur available to make felt caps for an army of
6,000,000 or 7,000,000 men. Accordingly a new cap was designed,
made of felt and doing away with the bad features of the melton cap;
but this cap improvement came at the end of the war and was never
used.</p>

<p>Wool was required not only for the outer clothing of the Army&mdash;for
the uniforms, overcoats, and caps&mdash;but there was also a tremendous
war demand for it for the manufacture of such knit goods as
undershirts, drawers, stockings, gloves, and puttees. The matter of
providing the Army with these necessary articles offered a problem
of peculiar difficulty, since, in addition to the ever-threatening
shortage of raw wool, there was an actual shortage of machinery in
the knitting industry. When it was found that the regular mills
could not turn out all the woolen knit goods the Army required,
numerous mills which had been turning out specialties exclusively,
such as women's underwear or men's union suits, were converted into
factories to knit garments according to the Army specifications.
Some idea of the extent of the Army's demand for this class of goods
may be read in the fact that toward the close of hostilities every
machine in the United States that could make hosiery at all was
knitting socks for the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time there was an acute shortage of needles. Germany
had previously supplied America with knitting needles. When this
source was cut off, we turned to Japan. The Japanese needles
proved disappointing; they were not correctly tempered and frequent
breakage caused great loss. At one time it was rumored that there
were 10,000,000 knitting needles in Sweden, and the need here was so
urgent that several buyers were sent to that country. Their effort
was well worth while, for they actually secured a million needles to
help relieve the situation here. Meanwhile, American needles were
improved and American needle makers were pushed to the limit;
but until the close of the war there was always an acute shortage of
needles for the knitting industry.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that there was not enough machinery in
America to knit one-tenth of the seamless woolen gloves that the
soldiers required. Consequently it was necessary to adopt a substitute&mdash;a
glove of knit fabric cut to pattern and sewed up with seams.
In actual service this glove did not stand up to the hard usage required
of it. Consequently there was designed an over-glove of
canton flannel with the palm cased in leather, this to be worn outside
the seamed woolen glove. In the effort to produce gloves which
would give longer wear the so-called ambidextrous glove was designed
so cut that it could be worn comfortably upon either hand.</p>

<p>Puttees, the spirally wound leggins that had long been used by the
British Army, were unknown articles to American manufacture when
the American Expeditionary Forces adopted them as standard
articles of equipment. A puttee of knitted wool was designed and
6,000,000 of them were ordered in the spring of 1918, these to be
preliminary to future orders for 8,000,000. The work required the
installation of much new machinery in the textile plants. On November
1, 1918, we had produced all the puttees required by the troops
then in France and had a surplus of 1,500,000 of them.</p>

<p>In the production of knit goods, economies in the use of material
were constantly effected. An original article of equipment for the
overseas troops had been a knitted woolen toque, which was a sort of
stocking-cap. The toques had cost the Government $1 apiece, and
some 1,500,000 of them had been piled up in the quartermaster warehouses
before the toque was abandoned as a piece of standard equipment.
Later a requisition was received for 400,000 woolen mufflers
to be used by drivers of automobiles and motor trucks. According
to the specifications these would cost about $3 apiece. Then it was
discovered here that the abandoned toques might be sewed together
to make mufflers. With this stock in hand it cost the Government
only 20 cents each for the mufflers instead of $3, a clear saving of over
$1,000,000.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster Department was the Mecca of inventors during
the war period, who came bringing real or fancied improvements in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
many lines of apparel and personal equipment. One brought in a
trench shower bath, consisting of a hot-water bag and a hose. He
was much chagrined when informed that if this apparatus were set up
in the trench there would be no room for soldiers to pass it. In no
respect did the inventors have more novel ideas than they had in the
manufacture of underwear. One of them brought in a patented
vacuum suit of underwear which acted on the principle of a fireless
cooker or thermos bottle to exclude the cold from the wearer's body.
However, he had failed to take into consideration the fact that not
only must cold be kept out, but perspiration must be given a chance
to escape. The vacuum underwear would never dry out, after a man
had become sweaty in it. For that reason it was not adopted.</p>

<p>A woman of Iowa invented cootie-proof underclothing by impregnating
underwear with vermin-destroying chemicals. The State of
Iowa was so interested in her invention that there was a public
movement to clothe all Iowa troops in this underwear, should the
Government fail to adopt it. The underwear was submitted to the
experts of the Bureau of Entomology (the Government agency that
deals with bugs), whose experts tested the invention. They found
that the underwear was indeed death to the cootie. However, if the
chemicals were applied in weak strength they soon evaporated and
left the underwear harmless to the insect; if applied in great strength,
the poisonous chemicals irritated the skin of the wearer.</p>

<p>During the first winter the men were in camp, the winter of 1917-18,
there was no time to provide the troops with standard Army underwear.
Consequently Government agents went into the underwear
market and bought outright whatever was in sight. As a result, the
soldiers that first winter wore underwear of almost every description
and grade of merit. This gave the Army's underwear experts a
fine opportunity to study the qualities of underwear of various
types as proved by actual use. These studies contained hints
of use to the civilian. For instance, the warning is plainly given to
wear no fleece-lined underwear. A study was made of the causes of
colds, and it was discovered that soldiers wearing fleece-lined underwear
caught cold more easily than those wearing any other sort.
The fleece of the lining absorbed perspiration and retained it, staying
damp. Since many of the soldiers slept in their underclothing, they
were thus encased in damp clothes 24 hours a day. Sick reports
plainly showed the result of it.</p>

<p>When it comes to the production of cotton cloth for the Army's
uses, the figures are so large as to appear almost fantastic. In all
we procured over 800,000,000 square yards of cotton textiles. This
was enough to carpet an area nearly four times as large as the District
of Columbia. In a strip 3 feet wide there was enough of it to wrap 18<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
layers of cloth around the equator. Spread this strip out on some
cosmic floor, and you could place upon it side by side 55 globes as
large as the earth.</p>

<p>In addition to the cotton khaki required for uniforms and other
purposes, the principal other cotton items were duck, denim, webbing,
gauze, venetian, sheets, pillowcases, and towels.</p>

<p>The purchases made by the Army were beyond anything that had
been known in the textile industry. In March, 1918, the supplies of
cotton khaki on hand seemed to indicate a surplus of 21,000,000 yards
beyond the needs of the immediate future. Then came the start of
the German drive, and by the middle of April this great surplus of
khaki cloth was not sufficient to the need. In other words, there
was a shortage of khaki, since the Army needed at once 25,000,000
yards and thereafter would require a monthly supply of 10,000,000
yards. This was looking toward the great increase in the number
of men soon to be called to the colors. It was planned to draft
300,000 in June alone, and subsequent drafts would be on a like scale.</p>

<p>In order to supply summer uniforms for these men it was necessary
for Army officers to get every yard of khaki goods in the country.
All stocks of goods in the hands of dealers and manufacturers were
inventoried, and the positive order went out of Washington forbidding
the use of khaki in articles for civilians. In spite of the Government's
tremendous demand upon a limited supply, these stocks of khaki were
acquired at a price 20 per cent lower than the prevailing market.</p>

<p>The requirements for cotton duck and cotton webbing also leaped
upward as soon as the United States began to avalanche soldiers upon
France. The demands were greater than could be supplied by the
output of mills regularly producing these materials, and consequently
the Clothing and Equipage Division called upon manufacturers of
similar materials to adapt their plants to the production of duck and
webbing. This they did, in many cases at considerable inconvenience
and expense. Among the concerns which assisted in supplying these
materials were manufacturers of carpets, automobile tire fabric, and
even lace.</p>

<p>Owing to the scarcity and the high cost of leather a great deal of
cotton webbing was substituted in the manufacture of such equipment
as cartridge belts, suspenders, gun slings, and horse bridles. Here
was additional demand, and to meet it factories which had been making
such things as asbestos brake linings, hose, lamp wicks, suspenders,
garters, cotton belting, and other similar fabrics, became webbing
mills. All these plants thus adapted to the emergency manufacture
of webbing were dependent on purchased yarns, which they
had to secure in the open market from yarn manufacturers.</p>

<p>In the South particularly, where most of this yarn was purchased,
the securing of power was a serious question. Many of the mills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
depended upon electricity generated by water power. These power
plants did not always have good railway connections and many
of them had no steam power equipment even if fuel could have
been furnished. In the late summer of 1918 the rivers of the South
ran nearly dry, and in order to operate many of the southern mills it was
necessary for the Government to allocate according to most pressing
needs the available power among the mills working on contracts.
Also, for a long time when transportation facilities were seriously
overtaxed, it was hard to secure a steady flow of materials from the
South to the northern mills.</p>

<p>With regard to labor, employees in the cotton and webbing mills
had to be educated in the manufacture of the new types of work to
which these plants had been shifted. In the South, more especially,
there was a question of child labor and of hours of labor for women
and minors; for the Government inserted clauses in the later contracts
requiring certain standards for the benefit and protection of
labor. In some instances contracts were returned because of the
child-labor clause. In such cases compulsory orders were often
issued, practically compelling the mills to produce the goods called for.</p>

<p>Considerable burlap used for packing, as well as burlap bags, silk
for flags, hat bands, and badges were also purchased in quantity.</p>

<p>The United States was never forced to turn to the use of paper
in the manufacture of clothing, as the central powers were compelled
to do; nevertheless preparation was made for the time when the
cotton supply of the United States might become unequal to the demand.
Garments made of paper cloth captured from the Germans
were shipped to the United States and carefully studied by the
Clothing and Equipage Division to learn the possibilities of paper
fabrics should the need for them develop.</p>

<p>Over 100,000,000 yards of denim were bought. Denim was used
particularly in making working clothes for the soldiers. At one time
the factories were consuming denim at the rate of 13,000,000 yards a
month. Brown denim which was required by regulations was a
material hard to get, blue denim being the standard fabric for American
overalls, and consequently heavy gray goods and drills were dyed
olive-drab and put into use.</p>

<p>As to gauze, about 140,000,000 yards of it were purchased. Sheets
and pillowcases were required in such quantities that at one time
every mill in the country whose normal business was the production
of sheeting was working for the Government. There were over
120,000,000 yards of webbing purchased, and nearly 300,000,000 yards
of the various kinds of duck.</p>

<p>The duck and webbing just mentioned went into the manufacture
of a numerous class of articles, known as textile equipment, including
such articles as belts, tool bags, tool kits, flasks, canteen covers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
the like. The procurement of the webbing for these articles was in
itself a manufacturing achievement. Before the war there were only
a half dozen plants in the United States which could make webbing
of the grade demanded by the Army. When the armistice came there
there were 150 such plants. At the beginning of the war an order
for 5,000,000 yards of webbing fairly staggered the industry, but that
industry was to witness the day when an order for 50,000,000 yards
would be absorbed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>But even after the webbing was secured there were practically no
factories in the United States that had machinery heavy enough to
make the Army's textile equipment. This work for the standing
Army had been done exclusively by the Rock Island Arsenal. In
order to increase the manufacturing capacity of the country it was
necessary to get the Singer Sewing Machine Co. to build special
machines adapted to this heavy work; and we also had to send experts
from the Rock Island Arsenal to teach all new contractors how to
make the articles. Many of the factory workers were women.</p>

<p>In spite of all difficulties production was wonderfully increased.
Along in January, 1918, about 100,000 pistol belts a month were
being made; while at the time of the signing of the armistice 560,000
were being manufactured monthly. Of cartridge belts in the same
period the production was increased from 85,000 to about 410,000
monthly, and of haversacks from 290,000 to about 850,000 monthly.</p>

<p>No soldier could be sent overseas without a haversack, a cartridge
belt, and a canteen cover; yet during the period of active hostilities
no movement of troops was delayed one day on account of the lack
of textile equipment. Up to December 1, 1918, the production of
haversacks was over 2,500,000 in number, costing over $8,000,000;
of canteen covers, about 3,750,000, costing $2,250,000; of cartridge
belts, about 1,500,000, costing over $4,000,000. Another large item
was bandoleers, which were procured to the number of over 31,000,000
at a cost of $5,500,000. These are only a few of the major items, but
they serve to illustrate the extent of the purchases of textile equipment.</p>

<p>At the end of hostilities the Government was buying textile equipment
at the rate of $22,000,000 a month, and was working toward
the goal of being able to supply 750,000 men a month with all articles
of textile equipment.</p>

<p>When the Army began to expand in size at an unexpected rate in
the spring of 1918, it created a great shortage in cotton underwear.
Government agents went out over the country and bought all cotton
underwear stocks. In order to provide a sufficient manufacturing
capacity for cotton underwear, women's underwear factories were
enlisted for war work, and so were even corset factories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>The Army experts in cotton textiles also effected many economies.
A standard pattern layout was drawn for the overall makers with
consequent large savings of cloth in the manufacture of brown denim
fatigue clothing, or soldiers' working clothes. At one time practically
every overall factory in the United States was making fatigue clothing
for the Army, after Gen. Pershing had cabled an order for 3,000,000
garments to be delivered in 90 days.</p>

<p>In making the soldiers' barrack bags, in which they pack their
clothing and personal effects, the manufacturers in cutting out the
pattern left a 3-inch strip of cloth. Army officers discovered these
3-inch strips and also noted the fact that every barrack bag must be
provided with a draw-string. The specifications were thereupon
changed so that these 3-inch strips could be used as draw-strings in
the barrack bags, a trifling economy apparently, yet amounting to a
saving of 6 cents in the cost of each one of millions of these bags.</p>

<p>A vast amount of tentage was required, not only for tents themselves,
but also for such articles as paulins, tent covers, bed rolls and
clothing rolls, canvas basins and buckets, bags for stakes, tool bags,
coal bags, and mail bags, cargo covers, wagon covers, horse covers,
and many similar articles.</p>

<p>Valuable work was done in substituting cotton thread for linen.
Linen thread became so scarce that the Ordnance Department commandeered
the whole supply. This worked havoc in the shoe industry,
and as a result the Council of National Defense secured from the
Ordnance Department enough linen thread to take care of the Army
shoe contracts. Nevertheless it was discovered that cotton thread
might be substituted for linen in many industries. In fact, it often
proved to be better than linen.</p>

<p>Valuable standard tests for waterproof cloth were also worked out.
These tests were developed at the Bureau of Chemistry, a branch of
the Department of Agriculture in Washington. In these tests cloth
was required to withstand a deluge of water equivalent in intensity
to a tropical rain, and also to undergo a dry temperature of 120&deg;
Fahrenheit. There were also tests to determine under what conditions
the cloth would mildew. These tests are expected to have a
use in the waterproof-goods industry in normal times.</p>

<p>Another important contribution of the Army to peace-time industry
was the design of the over-suit for the use of truck drivers. This was
a waterproof garment, air-tight and cold-proof. It is expected that
this new garment will continue in commercial use.</p>

<p>The principal items of rubber goods bought by the Army were
rubber boots and overshoes, raincoats, and slickers. The production
of rubber boots for the Army took practically the entire capacity of
all mills in the United States, the rubber boot manufacturers having
pledged themselves to discontinue their civilian business until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
needs of the Government were taken care of. Of different types of
rubber boots, the purchases were considerably over 4,000,000 pairs,
at the cost of $20,500,000.</p>

<p>Incidentally there was worked out an improvement in rubber
boots to prevent them from blistering the heels of wearers. It was
discovered that a rubber boot blisters the heel because it rubs slightly
as the wearer walks, no matter how well fitted to the foot the boot
may be. To the specifications for the Army's rubber boots was
added the requirement that straps be incorporated in the article to
be buckled both around the ankle and around the instep, thus
holding the boot so that it can not slip.</p>

<p>Raincoats caused a good deal of trouble, as there was not a sufficient
manufacturing capacity in this country to meet the requirements.
Practically all stocks of commercial raincoats were purchased, on
the theory that even a poor cover was better than none. As these
garments were made for civilian use, they were not built according
to Army specifications, and considerable criticism was made as to
their quality.</p>

<p>When the manufacture of raincoats commenced on a large scale,
many new concerns went into the business, and some of them, either
through lack of experience or through carelessness or intent, made
garments that were not properly cemented. This led to investigations
and indictments. The total purchases of ponchos, raincoats,
and slickers amounted to about 10,000,000 garments, costing over
$46,000,000.</p>

<p>In all 7,000,000 service hats of felt were manufactured on orders
placed by the War Department. The felt for these hats was made of
rabbit fur imported from Australia, New Zealand, and Russia and
produced in the United States. Hats were made principally at
Danbury, Conn., and Fall River, Mass., with smaller sources of
supply at Yonkers and Peekskill, N. Y., and Reading, Pa.</p>

<p>The numerous requirements of the Army for pillows created a shortage
in feathers. In all there were manufactured on Government
order 500,000 pillows weighing 2&frac12; pounds each. It had been the
original intention to fill these pillows with duck feathers; but when
the American duck-feather supply was exhausted and thousands of
the ducks of China had given up their plumage for the comfort of
the American soldiers, and still there were not enough feathers for
the pillows, adulterations with goose feathers and other light plumage
were permitted.</p>

<p>The procurement of leather for the Army, both the raw material
and the finished products of leather, was one of the most important
undertakings, the principal war uses for leather being in shoes for
the soldiers and in harness for the horses and mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Government entered the leather market it found a high
level of prices, due to the large quantities of leather and leather
equipment which America had been exporting to the European
nations at war. The tanners were called together, and they came
to an agreement with the Government as to the prices of all grades
of equipment which the Army expected to buy. The packers next
agreed on a maximum price for hides suitable for Army leathers.
The Government took an option on 750,000 hides then in the hands
of the packers.</p>

<p>By consulting with the industry at all times the Government officers
were able to stabilize prices of leather. The price of harness leather,
which was originally fixed at 66 cents per pound, was advanced only
4 cents during the 18 months of the war period, while russet leather
never advanced more than 4 cents per pound above the $1.03 fixed
at the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>As the stocks of leather on hand diminished it became necessary
to stimulate the production of leather goods, and there was formed
a hide and leather control board, with a representative on it from
each branch of the trade, one for harness, one for sole leather, one
for upper leather, and one for the sheepskin trade. This board also
inspected leather at all the tanneries and the finished leather in the
various factories, a course of action which resulted in great improvement
in the quality of leather, particularly in leather used in shoemaking.</p>

<p>At the outset the Quartermaster Corps, the Ordnance Department,
the Signal Corps, the Engineering Department, the Medical Department,
the Navy, and the Marine Corps were all buying leather or
leather equipment, and the Y. M. C. A. and the Red Cross were also
in the market for large amounts of leather materials. These activities,
except those of the Navy and Marine Corps, were all eventually
brought under the administration of the Clothing and Equipage
Division, thus virtually eliminating competition in the leather market.</p>

<p>At the signing of the armistice it is safe to say there was enough
leather equipment, either in the United States or in France, or in
process of manufacture here, to meet the needs of 5,000,000 men.
Leather equipment was available at all times. The principal items
of leather were harnesses, shoes, jerkins, gloves, and mittens.</p>

<p>In all, $75,000,000 was spent for harness and leather equipment.
The procurement of saddles in itself was a hard problem, since
there were only three or four makers of saddletrees in the United
States, and only one of these could get the ash or basswood required.
The division induced various furniture factories to install
the special lathes required for turning saddletrees, and in this way
built up eight factories, which gave us sufficient capacity. Belting
manufacturers and manufacturers of shoes were educated in the art
of producing the leather for the saddles. The Army harness is of russet
leather, a product for which there is no commercial demand. The
result is that surpluses of Army harness can not be disposed of to
advantage.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>The former American Army shoe built on the Munson last and
known as the russet marching shoe was machine sewed, had an upper of
calfskin with the rough side turned in, and was lined with duck. This
shoe proved to be short lived when subjected to the severe service in
France. At the beginning of the war a new shoe was designed for
trench service. This was a much heavier shoe and the calfskin of the
upper was turned rough side out. There was no lining in the shoe.
The shoe had two heavy soles, the outer one being hobnailed. Yet
this shoe, too, proved to be unsatisfactory for the service. The uppers
wore fairly well, but the soles could not stand the constant submerging
in mud and water. The demands of trench service eventually led to
the design of what was called the Pershing shoe. This was a shoe
with three heavy soles, stitched, screwed, and nailed together. It
had steel reinforcements on toe and heel. The outer sole was studded
with hobnails.</p>

<p>The original requisitions from France for this shoe called for leather
tanned with bark. As bark tanning is practically obsolete in the
United States to-day, it was necessary to go into the tanneries and
build up what was virtually a new industry. It may be mentioned
that the design for the Pershing shoe was completed in 30 days.</p>

<p>The culmination of the shoe development was the model known as
the Victory shoe. This model corrected certain defects in the Pershing
shoe. The Pershing shoe was prone to rip along the back stays,
and the upper did not fit snugly. In the Victory shoe the entire
back of the upper was one piece.</p>

<p>At one time 52 shoe factories in 13 States were working on Army
shoe contracts. A scheme of packing shoes for overseas shipment
in burlap bags instead of in boxes was worked out, and it resulted in
saving a great deal of space on board ship.</p>

<p>Machinery and tools for the shoe repair shops of the salvage division
were purchased by the Clothing and Equipage Division. This
was the first time that Uncle Sam had ever acted as cobbler for his
soldiers. About 2,000 machines for repairing shoes were bought,
besides some 28,000 repair kits, each one of which cost $135. Among
the items of supplies for the Army shoe repair shops may be noted
20,000,000 pairs of half soles.</p>

<p>A shoe waterproofing grease, or dubbin, as it is called, which had no
odor and which would not turn rancid, was developed. The experts
worked closely with officers in the field in training soldiers in the
care of shoes to make them last as long as possible. Every man
who received a new pair of shoes was required to break the pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
in by standing in them in water for a certain period and then
walking for an hour until the shoes dried on his feet. The men were
cautioned not to dry their shoes by placing them too closely to any
heating apparatus, as this shortens the life of the leather. Good care
of the soldier's feet has long been standard Army practice with us.
No soldier in 1917 and 1918 was permitted to wear darned socks,
unless he wore two pairs at once. At regular intervals officers inspected
their men's feet, treated any blisters or sores that might exist,
and dusted the feet with powder.</p>

<p>Bad shoe fitting means foot troubles, leg troubles, and sometimes
even spinal and mental troubles. E. J. Bliss, a Boston manufacturer
of shoes, developed a shoe fitting system which was adopted as being
unexcelled. The fitter was an implement about like a roller skate,
with movable wings on the sides and a movable plunger in front of
the toes. The soldier to be fitted equipped himself with rifle and
loaded pack. With this weight on his shoulders he stepped both feet
upon the skate-like devices and then raised on the balls of his feet,
until the weight and movement pressed out the wings as far as they
would go and advanced the front plungers. With the size thus automatically
determined, the next step was to check the accuracy of it.
This was done by inserting a pair of implements with knob-like ends
in the toes of the shoes, the implements just filling the space in front
of the soldier's toes. Wearing shoes and implements, the soldier
then walked about the room, stepped upon a platform, climbed a
cleated ramp, and otherwise simulated actual service demanded of
shoes in the field. If the checking implements in the shoes did not
hurt his toes the fit was regarded as correct.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

MISCELLANEOUS QUARTERMASTER UNDERTAKINGS.</h3>


<p>Sergt. Irving Berlin, one of the fountain sources of American jazz
music, found a special job cut out for him when he was drafted into
the military service. The needs of the war machine called upon a
wide range of individual talents, and this range did not exclude the
artists. The painters engaged in camouflage work and made sketches
and pictures of such things as unusual surgical operations for the
permanent records of the Government, the poets fired the zeal of
the country, and the musicians inspired the soldiers by providing
them with music.</p>

<p>The American Expeditionary Forces as they grew in size found
themselves possessed of some 390 regimental bands. These bands
organized themselves, gathered such music as they could get, practiced,
and presently regaled the soldiers of units to which they were
attached; and then the inevitable happened&mdash;they played and played
the same old pieces until their audiences yearned for something new.
One day a cry of distress trickled through the cables, and then the
plight of the hapless lover of band music in France became the problem
of the quartermaster organization in the United States, resulting
in the largest purchase of band music ever made, 200,000 sheets of it,
costing nearly $50,000.</p>

<p>The music problem of the American Expeditionary Forces was put
into the hands of a special committee of three well-known authorities
in the musical world. Sergt. Berlin was the authority on popular
numbers; Lieut. R. C. Deming, the bandmaster at Camp Meigs,
Washington, D. C., was the member in charge of the ceremonial
numbers; while Mr. Ward Stephens, the well-known composer,
organist, and accompanist, was in charge of the concerted numbers.</p>

<p>This committee picked out a repertoire of 333 selections, consisting
of 172 concert pieces, 43 ceremonial numbers, and 118 popular
numbers. Four hundred complete sets of these were bought, one for
each of the 390 bands of the American Expeditionary Forces, with 10
sets as a reserve. The music was bought from some 27 music
publishers, the largest suppliers being Carl Fischer, the Waterson,
Berlin &amp; Snyder Co., the Leo Feist Co., the Jerome H. Remick Co.,
and G. Schirmer (Inc.), all of New York, and the Oliver Ditson Co.,
of Boston.</p>

<p>Each complete set was packed in a separate case so that each case
upon arrival in France could be sent immediately to a band of the
American Expeditionary Forces without being disturbed. The sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>ing
and packing of this consignment of sheet music was handled
by Sergt. Berlin and a staff of technical musical assistants, who, at
his request, contributed their services.</p>

<p>The supply of music was but one of hundreds of enterprises required
to make the Army efficient, comfortable, and happy, quite
aside from the more obvious ones of supplying guns and ammunition,
artillery, aerial observation, and food and clothing. And these
scattered undertakings in military supplies accounted for the expenditure
of hundreds of millions of dollars. Nearly all of them were
quartermaster enterprises. But before we lift the curtain on this,
one of the most interesting branches of our military preparation,
involving, as it did, the scientific solution of problems ranging from
the production of super-gasoline for the fighting airplanes to the
proper and most economical method of cutting up the carcass of a
steer, let us continue the musical overture by observing how the
Army secured its band instruments.</p>

<p>There was a special branch of the Quartermaster Corps which
concerned itself exclusively with the musical requirements of the
Army. This branch bought in all approximately 143,000 musical
instruments. These were secured at a saving of about $500,000
under the prices which the Government had been paying for such
instruments prior to the war. Without going into the details of
how this economy was effected, one typical instance may be cited.
For years it had been the custom of manufacturers of musical instruments
to embellish the trumpets and brass horns of bandsmen with
engraving, chasings, and other markings. These were decorative
only and had nothing to do with the quality of tone produced. By
eliminating all such markings from the specifications, a substantial
saving in cost was attained.</p>

<p>The principal suppliers of musical instruments were the Wm.
Frank Co., of Chicago; J. M. York &amp; Son, of Grand Rapids, Mich.;
and the H. M. White Co., of Cleveland, Ohio. C. S. Conn &amp; Co., of
Elkhart, Ind.; the Eugene Geisler Co., of Chicago; and the Rudolph
Wurlitzer Co., of Cincinnati, also supplied several thousand musical
instruments.</p>


<h4>FUEL, OIL, AND PAINTS.</h4>

<p>During the months of hostilities the American public was constantly
informed in advertising literature that fuel would win the
war, and indeed fuel would win it, and did win it, in the sense that
without fuel or with any grave shortage of fuel we could not have
won. In this sense there was no commodity contributing to success
in the great drama more important than coal. Coal not only
furnished the power that transported the khaki-clad millions to
France, but it furnished the manufacturing power in the United
States and supplied the coke, which is essential to the manufacture
of steel, thus entering into every rifle and piece of artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>America began keeping the records of coal mining in the year 1807.
Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated President of the United States in
1913. In the 106 years between 1807 and 1913, and including those
years, American mines produced a total of 9,844,159,937 tons of coal.
In the succeeding five years of President Wilson's administration
American mines turned out 2,960,938,597 tons of coal, almost one-third
as much as was mined in the entire 1807-1913 period, and almost
one-fourth of all the coal mined in the United States since records
have been kept.</p>

<p>The American coal miners in 1918 met the war emergency by producing
150,000,000 tons of coal more than they had dug in 1914. The
shortage of coal in the winter of 1917-18 was due not to the inability
of the mines to produce the required tonnage but to inadequate railroad
transportation facilities and severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>The war-coal project was in the hands of the United States Fuel
Administration, but the office of the Quartermaster General assisted
in the effort. Army officers were stationed at the offices of the various
district representatives of the Fuel Administration throughout the
country. These officers kept in constant touch with the factories
making war supplies and saw to it that coal was diverted from less
essential enterprises to the munitions factories. This service operated
with such excellent effect that few manufacturers working
on Government contracts were compelled to suspend operations
because of the lack of fuel, and those who did have to suspend
were able to resume again within a few days.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1918 the usual seasonal slack in the demand
for fuel was taken up by the action of the fuel branch in absorbing
practically all of the excess coal in the United States and storing it at
Army posts, camps, and stations. This action kept the mines working
at maximum capacity during a period when there is normally a
curtailment in output. Of course, at the time there was no realization
that the fighting was to end so soon, and this policy was adopted
in preparation for unchecked industrial activity during the winter
of 1918-19.</p>

<p>The Army itself was a heavy user of fuel, requiring it not only at its
various manufacturing establishments but also at the great camps
for heating purposes. The following table shows the Army purchases
of fuel for the calendar year 1918.</p>

<p>The Army was an enormous consumer of oil, the total oil purchases,
both in the United States and in France, in the nine-month period
from April 1 to December 31, 1918, amounting to $30,522,837.
There were 49 items in the oil-purchasing schedule for the troops in the
United States alone, including lubricating oils, fuel oils, oils for
paints and varnishes, gasoline for motor trucks and airplanes, axle
grease, floor oil, tempering oil, oil for the preservation and waterproofing
of shoes, harness, and other leather equipment, and numerous
other varieties of oils. The gasoline purchases were heaviest of all,
Army motor trucks and cars in the United States requiring 484,282
barrels of it, worth $5,448,570, in the nine months between April 1
and December 31, 1918. The American Army motor trucks and cars
with the American Expeditionary Forces were supplied with 703,104
barrels, worth $10,104,437, in the same period. For Army airplanes
in the United States during the same months there were
purchased 306,082 barrels of special aviation gasoline, at a cost of
$3,906,650, and for the planes in France 146,780 barrels, worth
$2,748,839.</p>

<p>To give the American aviator the hottest, most instantaneously
explosive, and surest-fire gasoline ever produced, the American
refiners turned out a naphtha along specifications drawn by the
Government that was the highest refinement of gasoline ever produced
in large quantities. This was done by taking the best gasoline
that had ever been produced in commercial quantities and giving it
another run through the distilling retorts. Thus it was literally
the cream of the cream, containing only the most combustible elements
of liquid fuel and nothing else.</p>

<p>This refinement became known as "257&deg; fighting naphtha," and
the Army confined its use to the service planes actually at the front.
It was not supplied to the aviation training camps, either in this
country or in France. In order to distinguish this naphtha as the
finest engine fuel available and to mark it so that it would not be
wasted by accident in any use other than that of service at the
front, it was colored red with aniline dyes. The Army did not
even trust 257&deg; fighting naphtha to bulk transportation on tank
ships, but stored it in steel drums and freighted it across the ocean
in this form in cargo boats.</p>

<p>America has always been the largest producer of gasoline, and the
experience and development in this country has resulted in many
grades of the fuel. The ordinary commercial gasoline comes in five
grades, the best grade being known as "straight-run" gasoline and
the other grades, in the order of their cost and purity, as "casing-head,"
"blended," "pressure-still," and "cracked." For motor fuel
for the Army the quartermaster specifications would accept nothing
but "straight-run" gasoline, unblended and without dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
additions which have a damaging effect upon motor cylinders. This
gasoline, the best that could be bought by the civilian users, is
known as "428&deg; gasoline;" and it was the fuel used universally in
our motor trucks and motor cars.</p>

<p>Above that were the three grades of gasoline, or rather, naphtha,
produced specially for the American Army airplanes. The lowest
grade of these was called domestic aviation gasoline, and it was the
best commercial gasoline refined until its boiling point had been
brought down to 347&deg; F. This fuel was used by our aviators in
this country and was known as "347&deg; domestic aviation naphtha."
A still greater refinement was the splendid "302&deg; export aviation
naphtha," which was used by planes in France, other than those
at the front. The fighting naphtha was obtained by taking the
cream of export aviation naphtha. Although purchased in enormous
quantities, it cost the Government more than 41 cents a gallon.
The Government paid slightly less than 22 cents a gallon for its
motor gasoline.</p>

<p>Another new development in the oil industry brought about by
the Government's war needs was known as "Liberty aero oil."
This was an airplane lubricating oil of pure mineral origin, a refined
lubricant of excellent viscosity and a low cold test, an oil which
proved itself to be capable and reliable under the ever-changing
atmospheric and pressure conditions of mechanical flight at the
front. Liberty aero oil was a success. Most of it which was
shipped overseas was made from paraffin base oils, although in this
country we used successfully many aero oils of asphaltum base.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Department submitted a requisition for a three-months'
supply of pure neat's-foot oil, which was in quantity almost
twice the total American production of neat's-foot oil in the preceding
year. The Government oil experts worked out a satisfactory
substitute by combining animal and mineral oils. This was not only
equal to neat's-foot oil under tests, but it was considerably cheaper.</p>

<p>The American Expeditionary Forces submitted a rush order for
6,000,000 pounds of dark axle grease. The specifications called for
containers made of tin. But it was almost impossible to secure the
tin for such a shipment. Experiments were conducted with all
possible haste, and the result was a container made of black iron
sheets treated with a special varnish to prevent the moisture in the
grease from rusting the iron. This container proved to be satisfactory.</p>


<h4>BRUSHES.</h4>

<p>Offhand, one would scarcely say that brushes play any part of
vast importance in the life of an individual; yet to buy the brushes
for the Army required a special organization, competent to spend
money by the millions of dollars and get value received for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed it was quite surprising how many brushes in variety the
Army required. The tooth brush, the shaving brush, the hair brush,
the clothes brush, the shoe brush, and the paint brush might occur
to anybody as necessities; but the Army used all these and in addition,
artists' brushes, bottle brushes, chimney brushes, whitewashing
brushes, gun-cleaning brushes, floor brushes, roofing brushes, stove
brushes, horse brushes, and dozens of other kinds. In all, the Government
bought 9,224,210 brushes, at a cost of $3,039,000. It
required 59 factories in the United States to manufacture these
brushes. The most numerous class of all were the tooth brushes,
more than 1,500,000 of these being ordered from one company alone.</p>

<p>Brushes are made from many different materials, such as bristle,
horsehair, fiber of various kinds, imitation bristle, split quills, and
the like, but the most important is bristle. Only a little bristle is
produced in the United States in comparison to the demand for it,
the bulk of the supply coming from China, India, Siberia, and Russia.
The procurement of bristle was no small part of the problem of supplying
brushes for the Army.</p>

<p>Not one in every 10 tooth brushes used in the United States was of
American manufacture before the war, the rest coming from Japan,
France, England, Germany, and Austria. When the European
supply was cut off, Japan became the principal source of supply.
The problem of tooth brushes was further complicated by an embargo
on bristles coming into this country and another on the exporting
of bone to Japan.</p>

<p>The Army bought no shaving brushes made of horsehair, even in
part, since horsehair is known to be the carrier of the much dreaded
anthrax germ. The Government specified a shaving brush with an
abbreviated handle, making it more convenient to carry. A handle-less
hairbrush was also specified. Paint brushes were largely standardized,
but it was impossible to standardize toilet brushes because
there were not enough facilities in the country to turn out sufficient
quantities, if machinery had to be remodeled to meet Government
specifications.</p>


<h4>ROLLING KITCHENS.</h4>

<p>Those in charge of general quartermaster purchases designed and
produced the liberty rolling field kitchen, an equipment which could
cook for 200 men. Rolling field kitchens were not new to our Army
or the trade, there being about six types of commercial kitchens
manufactured at the time we entered the war. Most of these were
being produced on foreign war orders. In order, however, to secure
a standardized kitchen with interchangeable parts, thus insuring a
constant supply of spare parts, the division designed the liberty
kitchen. There were two types of it&mdash;the horse-drawn type and the
motor-drawn or trailmobile type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>Each kitchen consisted of a stove and a limber. The stove unit
contained a bake oven and three kettles. The limber contained four
bread boxes, which were also used as water containers, one cook's
chest, four fireless cookers, and four kettles. In July, 1918, contracts
were awarded for 15,000 complete kitchens, including the necessary
cooking and camp utensils. Deliveries of these kitchens eventually
reached a rate of over 200 per day.</p>

<p>Two factories adopted and installed track conveyor equipment on
which the assembling process was carried forward from operation to
operation until the finished kitchen, painted and boxed, was delivered
to the car for shipment to the port of embarkation. The kitchens
were packed each in a single crate, ready to be delivered to the front
after arriving in France.</p>

<p>Before this kitchen was designed the Army had been paying from
$700 to $1,050 apiece for rolling kitchens. The average price of the
liberty kitchen was $502. Subsequent orders brought the total
projected purchases of mobile kitchens to 25,000, of which 10,000
were of the animal-drawn type.</p>

<p>Substantial shipments of these kitchens had been received overseas
before hostilities ceased, and in November deliveries were
expanding at a rate which would have exceeded several times the
3,000 liberty kitchens required by the American Expeditionary
Forces by January 1, 1919. About 7,000 rolling kitchens of all
types were shipped to France.</p>


<h4>TOOLS AND TOOL CHESTS.</h4>

<p>Another important result accomplished in the purchase of general
supplies was the standardization of tool chests. At one time the
Army was buying and using approximately 100 different kinds of
quartermaster tool chests. A committee to standardize tools and
tool chests was appointed, and this committee reduced the number of
types of tool chests to seven standardized ones&mdash;the carpenter's
chest, the blacksmith's, the farrier's, the saddler's, the electrician's,
the plumber's, and the horseshoer's emergency chest.</p>

<p>The committee also standardized the tools. Many varieties of such
things as drawknives and handsaws had been purchased previously.
This committee adopted a standard type of draw knife and a standard
handsaw, and also standardized many other tools. Standardization
of tool chests effected a large saving in transportation space by keeping
the dimensions to a minimum. The standardized carpenter's
chest occupied 3&frac12; cubic feet less space than the older type wooden
chest.</p>

<p>Since at the time the armistice was signed the Army was in the
market for approximately 135,000 tool chests of the seven standardized
types, the saving in shipping space would have been no slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
achievement. But there was also in sight an enormous saving of
money, not to speak of the fact that standardization would greatly
increase the rate of manufacturing the chests.</p>


<h4>HARDWARE.</h4>

<p>The general supplies division of the quartermaster organization
operated much of the Army's hardware store. In this work the
division not only standardized Army tools, but also standardized the
proportions in which the various tools were bought. This was not
only an intensely interesting development, but it was of utmost
importance to the American people, since it saved large sums of
money and great quantities of shipping space.</p>

<p>The supply officers of the American Expeditionary Forces early
began making up their estimates of the materials that must be produced
in the United States and shipped to France, to maintain the
efficiency of an indefinitely growing Army over a protracted period of
time. In the matter of hardware these estimates came originally
from the company units. Each repair unit, for instance, would look
over the future, and its officers would estimate kinds and quantities
of tools required for such and such a period. These little estimates
came together in larger groups, and so on, the consolidation of figures
continuing until eventually in the case of a certain tool there would
be one figure on file at headquarters. Then one day one of those long
daily cablegrams from France, signed "Pershing," came to Washington,
bringing the future requirements for tools and other hardware.</p>

<p>Theoretically it might be assumed that the proportioning of items
in these requisitions would be correct and that the American Expeditionary
Forces might be expected to need tools in the proportions
named. Of course, Sergt. A, in a repair unit with the artillery, might
estimate too many hammers and too few wrenches, but Machinist X,
miles away in some base shop, might call for too many wrenches and
too few hammers. These two estimates would thus balance correctly;
and, following out this line of reasoning, it would seem that the entire
American Expeditionary Forces' hardware requisitions, compiled as
they were, would be properly proportioned.</p>

<p>Yet when these requisitions came to Washington and were found to
call for the manufacture of such things as files and bolts by the
tens of millions, the supply officers here would not accept the theory
that the proportions of various sizes called for were correct, but
turned the searchlight of science upon these estimates.</p>

<p>The method selected of checking these estimates was simplicity
itself, yet unique in the history of American industry and almost
majestic in the scope of its comprehensive vision. The officer in
charge of the procurement of hardware, in the case of files, for instance,
simply called together the entire file-manufacturing industry&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>and
that means that not a single manufacturer was overlooked&mdash;and
asked that industry to assemble the results of its experience over
a period of the last five or six years. Each manufacturer would
show, for instance, how many flat files he had sold of each length and
of each type of cutting surface&mdash;either bastard, second cut, or
smooth&mdash;how many half-round files, how many hand files, how many
round files, how many square files, how many warding files, how many
knife files, how many taper files, etc., all by lengths and by cutting
surfaces. Thus when all these experience figures were assembled,
the officers in charge at Washington knew exactly in what proportions
the whole American industrial world had used files of various types
throughout a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>This procedure was followed with respect to many common articles
in hardware. The Hardware Manufacturers' Organization for War
Service was formed to give just such assistance, cooperating up to
100 per cent of the hardware industry. The consolidation of the
experience figures in American hardware consumption resulted in a
schedule of supplies known as the Army's hardware tariff, a schedule
showing the proportions in which hardware might be expected to be
consumed.</p>

<p>The hardware tariff disclosed some surprising errors in the estimates
from the American Expeditionary Forces. The American Expeditionary
Forces' requisitions, for instance, had called for a total of
127,180,387 bolts of various kinds. The experience of bolt consumption
in the American industry was able to correct this to a total of
125,285,000 bolts, or a saving of nearly 2,000,000 in number of pieces.
The requisitions had called for 39,945,458 large carriage bolts. The
experience of American consumption showed that only 9,700,000
large carriage bolts would be required. The original specifications
had called for 31,839,741 small carriage bolts. The experience in
American consumption showed that 60,300,000 would be necessary.
In other words, the off-hand estimates of the American Expeditionary
Forces had called for 30,000,000 too many large carriage bolts and
nearly 30,000,000 too few small carriage bolts.</p>

<p>The specifications from France called for 5,000,000 stove bolts of
the five-eighths-inch dimension. Since this size was not used or was
not made at all by stove-bolt manufacturers, the item was canceled,
and 2,000,000 smaller-dimension bolts substituted.</p>

<p>All bolts were supplied in quantities and proportions determined
by following the proportions of the scientific tariff. They were
shipped to France in these proportions, whence reports from the
American Expeditionary Forces showed that the quantities sent completely
covered the needs of the troops in the field. The saving in
the manufacture of bolts alone came to nearly $4,000,000, and this
says nothing of the saving in railroad and ocean freight charges, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
the still more important saving in ocean tonnage space, since the
bolts supplied according to the scientific tariff occupied many hundreds
of cubic feet less space than the bolts originally specified would
have filled.</p>

<p>The same procedure was followed in the supplying of files. The
hardware manufacturers consulted their records and on the basis of
actual consumption in American industry discovered that a repair
unit consisting of a machine shop, a horseshoeing shop, a blacksmith
shop, and a woodworking shop, with 11 mechanics working in the
unit, would consume 305 dozen files per year, the experience tables
showing precisely the proportions of the various sizes of files in this
consumption. Consequently, when the American Expeditionary
Forces requested 439,200 dozen files, the quantities of each size, kind,
and style as specified in the requisition from France were disregarded,
and the so-called tariff proportions substituted. The files as supplied
not only proved adequate in number in every style, but they
cost $250,000 less than it would have cost to fill the original order.
Moreover, by using tariff sizes the industry was able to make immediate
shipments and to run at full production from the start, since it
needed only to produce files in the proportions known in the regular
trade.</p>

<p>What was done with bolts and files was done in many other lines
of hardware. When the American Expeditionary Forces saw that
its hardware was coming in correct quantities, its officers notified the
hardware supply organization to ship all tools and hardware materials
in accordance with the so-called tariffs. The executive committee
of the Hardware Manufacturers' Association for War Service, which
made possible this achievement in commercial science, consisted of
Messrs. Murray Sargent, Alexander Stanley, Charles W. Asbury,
Fayette R. Plumb, and Isaac Black.</p>

<p>The standardization of proportions in the hardware supply succeeded
in cutting an original requisition of the American Expeditionary
Forces for 8,750 tinners' machines to 860, and an original
requisition for 21,600 tinners' assorted groovers to 240, and still
met every need of the Army's tin shops in France.</p>

<p>The Army hardware office was also called upon to supply such small
hardware as fasteners for gas-mask knapsacks and pistol holsters,
and some metallic parts for cartridge belts and similar goods. Less
than two months before the armistice was signed orders were in sight
for the manufacture of some 500,000,000 pieces of these small metallic
devices. Most of them were to be made of brass. The uses of the
Army in October, 1918, were calling for these articles in such quantities
that it required approximately 250,000 pounds of brass per
working day to meet the demand.</p>

<p>At one time there came an order to procure 135,000,000 stud fasteners
within approximately 90 days. The result was that one manufacturer,
who had been producing 400,000 such fasteners in a day
succeeded in raising his production to 1,000,000 per day, and this
was only typical of the expansion elsewhere in the industry. The
demands of the Army overtaxed the brass rolling-mill capacity of
the land. As a result the hardware specialists investigated the possibility
of substituting iron and steel for brass, and these substitutes
were under consideration when the war came to an end.</p>

<p>Vast quantities of large sizes of rope were requested for overseas
to replace steel hoisting cables, which could not be secured in sufficient
quantities. Standard specifications drawn by the Government
in cooperation with rope manufacturers insured the supply to the
Army of rope only of the highest grades. Approximately 14,000,000
pounds of manila rope, 2,500,000 pounds of halter rope, and 2,000,000
pounds of cotton and jute twine were purchased at a cost of approximately
$9,000,000.</p>

<p>Army hardware men bought 1,534,679 axes, at a cost of $1,838,979.
They bought 1,256,994 shovels at a cost of $1,140,412, and 425,522
wrenches costing $395,776. They purchased 380,752 fire extinguishers
at a cost of $1,761,711. They purchased 2,621,521 safety razors
and 45,300,000 safety razor blades, the razors costing $3,171,806 and
the blades $1,318,750. These items selected at random give some
idea of the extent of the Army's hardware business.</p>


<h4>QUARTERMASTER FACTORY ENTERPRISES.</h4>

<p>It may not be generally known that the Quartermaster organization
was an extensive manufacturer of war goods in Government
shops. In another chapter has been described the method by which
the Army was supplied with clothing. While many of the clothing
contractors were private manufacturers, the Government itself manufactured
more uniforms than it secured from any single outside source.</p>

<p>There were two Government uniform factories&mdash;one at the plant
of the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot and the other at the Jeffersonville
(Ind.) Quartermaster Depot. The Philadelphia factory also
manufactured chevrons, flags, and tents. The Jeffersonville depot
produced army shirts in addition to outer clothing. The Jeffersonville
depot expanded in size during the war until it became the largest
shirt manufacturing establishment in the world. When the armistice
was signed the Philadelphia uniform factory was rapidly gaining the
eminence of being the largest clothing manufacturing plant in the
United States.</p>

<p>The total value of the articles manufactured by the Philadelphia
Quartermaster Depot during the war was $26,230,000. The gar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>ment
factory at Philadelphia was started in June, 1918, and in five
months it turned out 751,883 garments and 45,578 flags of various
kinds. It was working toward an output of 12,000 pairs of trousers
and 6,000 woolen coats per day. There were 3,000 employees in the
shop and 2,000 outside seamstresses. The outside seamstresses made
denim jumpers and trousers, white clothing, and olive drab shirts,
the production of shirts alone reaching a total of 1,359,801 garments.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia factory attained an output of 5,000 pairs of
chevrons per day, most of them embroidered by hand or by machinery.
Before the war the Philadelphia factory had a maximum
capacity of 68 pyramidal tents per day. This output was raised to
300 per day.</p>

<p>The Jeffersonville uniform factory was established in February,
1918. Jeffersonville is just a few minutes' ride from Louisville, Ky.,
which is a clothing center, and therefore there was little trouble in
securing experienced workers. The factory was operated day and
night with two shifts, each working eight hours. The plant reached
a capacity of 750 woolen coats and 1,500 pairs of woolen trousers per
day. The salaries of the women employees ranged from $50 to $80
per month. The Government established at Jeffersonville one of the
most modern woolen cloth shrinking plants in the United States,
costing approximately $50,000 and providing a capacity for sponging
10,000 yards of cloth per day. The Army supply officers pronounced
the uniforms turned out at Jeffersonville to be the best and most
honestly made clothing delivered to the Army during the war, yet the
cost of manufacturing uniforms in this plant was at least 25 per cent
under the average price paid to private contractors. The average
cost of making a woolen service coat at Jeffersonville was $1.02, and
the average cost of making a pair of woolen trousers was 54 cents.</p>

<p>The shirt factory at Jeffersonville was that depot's largest manufacturing
enterprise. The Jeffersonville depot had been making army
shirts since 1872. The shirt factory greatly expanded during the
Spanish-American War, until it was employing nearly 2,000 operatives,
mostly home workers. Thereafter the depot continued to
make shirts at the rate of about 200,000 per year until the United
States declared war against Germany, and in that time it had accumulated
a roll of 2,000 sewing operatives who had worked for the
factory at one time or other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p>When the great demand for shirts came in the spring of 1917, the
most expert of these seamstresses were hired outright by the month
to act as instructors in the homes of new sewing women who had
volunteered for the work. Advertisements were then sent out
through the newspapers of that entire section for women workers,
and presently the factory had a sewing force of 20,000 operatives
from practically every town and village throughout southern Indiana
and northwestern Kentucky. The output of shirts was increased
from 600,000 per year to 8,500,000. Each home worker was supplied
with one complete shirt to be used as a guide, and she secured
from the factory as often as she needed it shirt material cut from the
pattern and tied up in bundles of 10 sets. A large corps of sanitary
inspectors was employed to visit the thousands of homes and see to
it that the shirts were made under proper conditions. All shirts
accepted from the home workers were thoroughly fumigated before
being issued from the depot.</p>


<h4>SHOE FITTING.</h4>

<p>The Quartermaster Department, along with its other activities, was
a school-teacher on a large scale. Without going into a general
description of the quartermaster schools and the branches they taught,
we will here consider some of the most interesting educational enterprises
such as the shoe-fitting schools, the schools for butchers,
and the school of goods packing.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in this volume the mechanical system of shoe measuring,
perfected and adopted by the War Department, was described.
Studies made at the camps at various times during 1917 and 1918,
studies which examined nearly 59,000 men, showed that a little more
than 70 per cent were wearing shoes too short, more than 9 per cent
were wearing shoes too long, while less than 19 per cent were correctly
fitted. It is probable that these proportions ran clear through the
Army before shoe fitting was scientifically taken up, and there is
no reason to believe that in civil life the averages of correct shoe
fitting are any better.</p>

<p>After the so-called Resco system of shoe fitting was adopted,
schools for shoe measuring were held at Camp Meigs, D. C., and at
Jefferson Barracks, Mo. Each camp and cantonment in the country
sent two officers to one or the other of these schools. The course of
instruction lasted five days and consisted of lectures by experts and
demonstrations of the various appliances. In this way the science
of correct shoe fitting was scattered throughout the Army.</p>


<h4>MEAT CUTTING.</h4>

<p>It is no easy trick to teach a man to cut meat properly; butchering
is a skilled trade. As soon as it was apparent that the American
Expeditionary Forces in France were to be greatly expanded in size,
our officers overseas sent requests that several trained and experienced
butchery companies be sent over to cut meats properly for the
organizations abroad. In order to comply with this request there
was added to the curriculum of the quartermaster training camp in
Florida a butchery course in the cutting, boning, rolling, and tying
of fresh and frozen beef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>In this course there was developed an entirely new method of
cutting beef known as the "natural guide" method; and by it men
who had never cut meat before were developed into practical meat
cutters in less than eight weeks of instruction and practice. The
natural guide method, which was found to be far superior for Army
use to any other meat-cutting system which had been known, was
exactly what it was named, as it was essentially a separating rather
than a cutting process. The beef quarters were boned and divided
into their major parts by following the natural separations between
muscles, tissues, and bones.</p>

<p>This method, which is not at all like that in commercial use,
proved to be more economical than any meat-cutting system known,
because it utilized every ounce of meat and produced a greater proportion
of choice cuts suitable for pot roasts and other roasts than
the older Army Cooks' Manual method of meat cutting. The Cooks'
Manual method was similar to the method used by the retail butcher,
in that it cut meat along artificial indetermined lines. The natural
guide method actually produced 3 per cent more edible meat than
the other method, since even the most expert meat cutters can not
remove all meat from the bones by the Cooks' Manual method.
Moreover, by the natural guide method all cuts are uniform, and the
fats, suets, and bones are separated as clean, sweet, edible products.</p>

<p>Butchery companies were trained by the natural guide method
and sent overseas in numbers sufficient for the requirements of the
American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>After the discovery of this method and the fact that it produced
at least 3 per cent more meat than even the expert cutters could
secure by the artificial cutting system, it was evident that further
research work along this line would be profitable. Even expert
butchers, in spite of all their skill and care, wasted meat. What must
be the conditions in the mess kitchens of the Army where the cooks,
with no expert knowledge of butchery, cut the meats? It was evident
that numerous edible by-products of meat, such as fats and
marrow, were going into the kitchen garbage pails and thence to the
rendering plants.</p>

<p>The result of the investigation was a project to establish central
meat-cutting and rendering plants for all large concentrations of
troops, where all meats would be cut, boned, rolled, and tied, by experts,
and delivered direct to the company kitchens ready for roasting
or cooking in any manner. The fat and suet at such plants would
not be soiled or made unsound by handling, and so it could be rendered
and its food value retained. The oil could be cooked from the
bones as a valuable by-product, the bones could be dried and sold
commercially, and the plant could also have machinery for making
sausage and hamburg steak. A plant of this character was put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
operation during the summer and autumn of 1918 at Camp Johnston,
the quartermaster training camp, and it proved to be a complete success.
When the armistice was signed, the General Staff was considering
the proposition of establishing these centralized meat plants at all
the larger camps.</p>

<p>The meat experts also effected notable economies in ship space by
developing what was known as shankless beef. Shank-less beef was
beef quarters with the four shanks removed. Quarters thus prepared
occupied 14 per cent less freezer, cargo, and shipping space than
quarters with their shanks.</p>

<p>A still further economy in shipping space was projected in the plan
to bone all beef at the packing plants and ship it boxed or frozen in
molds and wrapped in burlap. This method saved about 50 per cent
of cargo space, and it began to be extensively used during the winter
of 1918-19. One set of packages included tenderloins, sirloins, butts,
loin steaks, top rounds, and shoulder steaks. Another set of packages
contained roasts, including prime ribs, rumps, bottom rounds,
and bottom chucks. A third set was for stews, including flanks, plates,
blades, necks, shanks, and trimmings.</p>


<h4>PACKING.</h4>

<p>American exporters generally for many years have had the reputation
of packing goods improperly for overseas shipment. Time and
again travelers and investigators in foreign lands have pointed out
that if America expected to compete successfully with other manufacturing
nations in foreign trade, she must learn to pack goods so
that the packages will not break en route and damage the contents.
When we sent an Army of over 2,000,000 men to France, it was
evident that unless we learned quickly how to put up our supplies
properly for overseas shipment, our lack of knowledge would be
costly to us.</p>

<p>Accordingly the packing service branch of the Quartermaster Department
was established. One of its first acts was to set up a school
of baling, packing, and crating, this school being located at the Forest
Products Laboratory at Madison, Wis., where studies of packing were
being made by scientists. The school started in July, 1918, and before
the armistice came it had graduated 400 students from its six-weeks'
course.</p>

<p>Now, while it was important that Army supplies reached the other
side in good condition, it was soon seen that of even greater importance
would be the economy that might be effected in shipping space
by the scientific packing of goods. This obscure and little known
packing service branch was really one of the most important agencies
in the whole war organization, since the results which it accomplished
in the saving of ship space were nothing short of astonishing. These
economies came at a time when the German submarines were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
highly destructive to American and allied shipping, and the shortage
of ocean tonnage was one of the most disturbing factors in the whole
war situation. The American packing service, in saving thousands
of tons of shipping space, in reality offset the operations of the
U-boats over a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>These space economies resulted usually from specifications drawn
by the packing experts reducing the sizes of packing cases that were
too large for the goods contained, and also by packing articles more
compactly. For instance, these experts studied the rolling kitchen
and determined the most compact assembly of its parts in a crate.
The crate was then carefully designed to occupy a minimum amount
of space. Some 18,000 rolling kitchens were packed ready for shipment
to France. Had all of these been floated, a total of 22,500
cubic tons of ship space would have been saved, or the equivalent of
five or six whole shiploads. As it was, room aboard ship could be
found for only 6,940 rolling kitchens, which by being scientifically
packed occupied 8,700 cubic tons less cargo space, or about two
whole shiploads, than they would have occupied otherwise.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, entire units of such heavy articles as escort
wagons and ambulances were packed in single crates. Wherever
open spaces were inevitable in the crating, these vacancies were filled
with various subsistence stores, such as dried peas or beans. Galvanized-iron
cans, for instance, were packed with two sacks of flour
inside each one.</p>

<p>The experts studied boxing to determine the best thickness of wood
required by various commodities and the proper method of strapping
or otherwise fastening the boxes. As a result there was a great
improvement in the condition of goods arriving in France.</p>

<p>In no respect did the packing service effect greater space
economy than in the packing of clothes for the American Expeditionary
Forces. Formerly clothing had gone forward to troops packed
loosely in wooden boxes. The packing service devised the system of
baling all clothing, and a baling plant was set up at the Army supply
base in Brooklyn. The service gave scientific attention to the proper
folding of garments and eventually, after exhaustive experiments,
developed a system of folding that allowed the maximum number of
pieces which could go into a bale. It was found that these new methods
saved two-thirds of the space that had been used formerly for the
shipment of the same quantity of goods in boxes, to say nothing of
the great saving both in labor and in boxing materials.</p>

<p>The baling plant at New York in the calendar year 1918 shipped to
France approximately 1,000,000 bales of clothing and textile and
other equipment that could be baled. The saving in money to the
United States Government by this method of packing at this one plant
in a single year amounted to approximately $55,000,000. The largest
item in this economy was the matter of cargo space, which is estimated
at $49,080,000 saved to the Government. The complete statement
of the financial saving in the shipment of these 1,000,000 bales is as
follows:</p>

</table>

<p>In addition to the financial saving there was a large saving in raw
materials, which count for more than money to a nation engaged in a
desperate war. This million bales of clothing saved 58,000,000 board
feet of lumber, which would have been used in boxing had the old
system of packing been followed. The lumber which might have gone
into these boxes requires 30 years for its growth, but the burlap covering
the bales was made of jute, which is raised in semiannual crops.</p>

<p>The size of the bale adopted was 30 by 15 by 14 inches and up to
19 inches. It is interesting to note that this size was determined
upon because it was found that the burlap covering such bales of this
size would cut into sandbags with a minimum amount of waste
material. The Army abroad used great quantities of sandbags.
Thus, by wrapping bales in burlap pieces of proper size, there was
saved a considerable amount of cargo space previously occupied by
baled burlap being shipped to France to be made into sandbags. It
is also notable that baled clothing arrived in France in much better
condition than clothing which had been packed in cases.</p>


<h4>HORSES AND MULES.</h4>

<p>The Quartermaster Corps was charged with the duty of providing
horses and mules for the Army. This function is known technically
as remount, and the buying of horses was in the hands of the remount
division.</p>

<p>There were three permanent remount depots in the United States
when the war began in April, 1917&mdash;one at Front Royal, Va., one at
Fort Reno, Okla., and one at Keogh, Mont.,&mdash;an auxiliary remount
depot at Fort Bliss, Tex., and a purchasing headquarters at Kansas
City, Mo. When it became apparent that the Army would need a
large number of horses, some of the most celebrated horsemen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
riders in the country offered their services as buyers. Some 50 of
them were commissioned as captains in the Quartermaster Reserve
Corps and sent to the various purchasing headquarters for short training
in the proper types of horses and animals required by the Army.
These buyers purchased a large number of excellent animals.</p>

<p>In addition to the existing three remount depots there were established
33 additional auxiliary remount depots and two animal embarkation
depots. The horses purchased were shipped to the various
remount depots and there trained and conditioned for Army use.</p>

<p>It required a large number of officers and men to care for the
remount establishment. Shortly before the armistice was signed
there were approximately 400 officers and 19,000 enlisted men in the
American remount service. The following statement shows the total
numbers of horses and mules purchased for the American Army in
the calendar years 1917-18, including those acquired by the remount
service in France:</p>

<p>Thousands of American animals were shipped to the American
Expeditionary Forces in France. Because of the lack of tonnage
there were no animal shipments between March 26, 1918, and August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
11. Between the declaration of war and March 26, 1918, a total of
30,329 animals were shipped abroad, and in the August 12-November
30 period 37,619 animals crossed the Atlantic, making a total of 67,948
American horses and mules sent to the American Expeditionary
Forces.</p>

<p>The total expenditures of the Army both abroad and at home for
horses and mules during the war period was $115,957,000, divided
about half and half between the United States on the one hand and
France, England, and Spain on the other.</p>

<p>The largest remount depot developed during the war is located
at Camp Jackson, Columbia, S. C. This depot has a capacity of
about 10,000 animals and its construction cost was about $300,000.
Soon after the armistice was signed, when it became apparent that
animals would no longer be needed, thousands of horses and mules
at the different remount depots were sold at auction, these auction
sales drawing large crowds of buyers.</p>


<h4>STORAGE.</h4>

<p>The problem of storing Army supplies became great only after hostilities
had ceased. Before that time supplies were going through the
warehouses and to the ships at the deep-water ports so rapidly that
there was no backing up of the tide of them in the vast warehouse
facilities that had been provided as a war measure. But as soon as
the armistice was signed and the Army no longer grew in size but
rapidly diminished as men were discharged, the manufacturing
operations under way, necessarily continued for a time on a scale
which had been developed in preparation for an Army nearly double
the size of the one that existed on November 11, 1918, soon began
filling up the warehouses.</p>

<p>The total storage capacity which the Army had on hand at the
time of the fighting, exclusive of that at ports and that for the
Department of Military Aeronautics, was as follows:</p>

<p>The operation of one of the Quartermaster depot warehouses might
be described at this point, and the general supply depot at Jeffersonville,
Ind., is typical. During the war this depot procured for the
Quartermaster Corps of the entire Army all horse-drawn vehicles
and harness, and such items as barrack ranges, field ranges, and
ovens, pack-train equipment, and other supplies.</p>

<p>The war deliveries began at Jeffersonville in the late summer of
1917. Receipts soon outgrew storage space. Adjoining lands were
leased, and supplies, covered by paulins, were stored in the open.
This early period of the war, prior to the spring of 1918, was a back-up
period at all the warehouses, as supplies were produced faster than
men were trained and transported to France. In the late spring of
1918 Jeffersonville began making heavy shipments of supplies overseas
and from then on shipments exceeded receipts. For three months
before the armistice was signed the Jeffersonville depot's shipments
averaged 60 carloads a day and its receipts about 25 carloads.</p>

<p>After the armistice was signed, Jeffersonville was designated as
the depot for the storage of all surplus horse-drawn vehicles and
black harnesses therefor. Extensive temporary storage sheds were
erected. Inbound shipments increased to about 80 cars a day. The
depot has stored 4,000 rolling kitchens of the trailmobile type, these
kitchens being packed in boxes, each package weighing about
4,300 pounds. The work of storing these kitchens is still in progress,
and the pile of boxes will ultimately be 45 feet wide, 30 feet high, and
1,000 feet long. As the pile is made, corrugated-iron roofing is placed
on the sides and top, thus forming a waterproof building.</p>

<p>Crated automobile trailers, weighing about 9,000 pounds per crate,
are being handled in the same manner. Wagons are stored in galvanized-iron
warehouses, each one capable of receiving 2,500 wagons,
without wheels. Wagon wheels are stored in specially adapted sheds.
About 2,000 automobile trucks have already been received for storage
in specially constructed sheds. These trucks are mainly Nash Quads,
four-wheel-drive trucks, and G. M. C. ambulance chassis. These
chassis are stored on end, resting on the bumpers. The engines of
all trucks are well oiled and the magnetos are covered with waterproof
material.</p>

<p>As the supplies backed up into the warehouses, it became necessary
for the Army to know where it stood in the matter of property;
and a complete inventory was ordered, since there had been no time
during the hurry and bustle of the war period to take stock. This
inventory in itself was an enormous undertaking. To prepare for
it the quartermaster training school at Camp Meigs, D. C., was
completely transformed into a school for training experts for taking
inventories. A standard scheme was worked out. The experts,
after being trained in the standard method, were sent out into
every zone in the country as instructors. In each zone they convened
the so-called "town meetings." The town meeting was
made up of Army storekeepers from each depot, post, camp, and
station in the zone&mdash;any place where Army supplies were stored.
These representatives were schooled in the inventory method and
then sent back to their stations with instructions to start the inventory
on December 31, 1918. The next operation was to organize
an inventory factory in Washington as the consolidating point for
all the inventories in the United States.</p>

<p>Some idea of the number of articles which Uncle Sam accumulated
as a result of the war may be gained from the fact that the inventories
received in Washington filled 40,600 sheets of paper, the size of an
ordinary large letterhead, with typewriting single spaced. To take
the inventory required a force in Washington of approximately
100 officers and 400 civilians, while there were probably over 10,000
officers and men engaged in the entire operation over the country.
The inventory was undoubtedly the largest ever taken in the world.</p>

<p>Before the war the standard items of Army supplies had been
20,000. The inventory in the consolidation of its figures in Washington
disclosed the fact that at the beginning of the year 1919
there were 120,000 standard items, and many of these stood for large
quantities of individual pieces. As this report is written, a catalogue,
or standard nomenclature list of supplies, comprising 120,000 items,
is being prepared, to establish throughout the United States one
language of supply for all items stored, distributed, and issued
under the direction of the Director of Storage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

MOTOR AND HORSE-DRAWN VEHICLES.</h3>


<p>The punitive expedition into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco Villa
marked the real beginning of the use of motor transportation for the
Army, although for many years the motor truck had received some
attention for military purposes.</p>

<p>In 1904 a few progressive officers at West Point made preliminary
tests of 1&frac12;-ton trucks, but these tests, while demonstrating that the
truck would doubtless be of value to the Army in the future, were
not sufficiently successful to create any particular interest. A few
trucks were in use in the Army in 1907, but no systematic tests were
made until 1912. At that time officers were seriously studying the
motor transportation needs and problems of the Army.</p>

<p>In 1914 the Society of Automobile Engineers, having learned from
the experience of European nations then at war that motor transportation
is one of the most vital factors in the success of any army,
offered its services to our War Department for the purpose of making
a complete survey of the automotive industry, in the hope that the
interests of the industry and of the Army could be coordinated so
that in an extreme emergency the industry might be able to provide
the necessary motor equipment for the Army, and that the Army
might be able to use such equipment in the most efficient manner.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this offer, on April 28, 1916, the War Department
asked the society's cooperation in issuing revised specifications for
the purchase of 1&frac12;-ton and 3-ton Army trucks. In May of the
same year, a committee consisting of the engineers from five companies
manufacturing trucks, from five companies assembling
trucks, and an engineer from a truck company not making the
types of trucks under consideration, was appointed to cooperate
with Army officers in making plans to provide our troops with
motor vehicles suitable to their needs. On this committee were
representatives of the Locomobile Co. of America, the Packard
Motor Car Co., the Peerless Motor Car Co., the Pierce-Arrow Motor
Car Co., the Kelly-Springfield Motor Truck Co., the Selden Motor
Vehicle Co., the Commercial Truck Co. of America, the White Co.,
and the General Motors Co. This committee went over the
Government specifications for the 1&frac12;-ton and 3-ton trucks, which
had been proposed by the Army, and after a few changes had been
made, the specifications were drawn up for what then seemed to be
the ideal trucks for Army use in these two sizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<p>Trucks at this time were urgently needed for our forces along the
Mexican border and for the punitive expedition entering Mexico.
Consequently rush orders for the first large quantities of trucks ever
purchased or used by our Army were placed with the White Co., the
Packard Motor Car Co., The Garford Motor Truck Co., the Kelly-Springfield
Motor Truck Co., the Four Wheel Drive Co., and the
Jeffery (Nash) Quad. It was with the trucks of these concerns that
our Army officers obtained their first real experience on a big scale
with motor transportation. The trucks themselves also received
the most severe tests while in service on the border and in Mexico.</p>

<p>Not only did the Army officers secure valuable experience in
operating this motor equipment but the manufacturer also took this
exceptional opportunity to study motor vehicles in actual operation
under Army conditions, and early in 1917 revised specifications for
Army trucks were issued as a result of the numerous conferences that
had been held between representatives of the War Department and the
automobile industry.</p>

<p>In May standard specifications for the so-called class A (1&frac12;-ton to
2-ton) and the class B (3-ton to 5-ton) motor trucks were established,
showing that the fundamental requirements of motor trucks for the
Army were as follows: low-gear reduction, larger engines, 4-speed
transmission (with very low first speed), maximum ground clearance,
demountable tires of standardized size and specifications, large
gasoline tank, electric lighting system, 3-point engine suspension,
locking differential, extra quality alloy steel springs, and larger
radiators.</p>

<p>After deciding on the requisites of an Army truck, the matter of
standardization began to receive definite attention, it being the belief
of many of the Army officers that it would be entirely possible and
practicable so to standardize Army vehicles that but one type of
truck would be sufficient for each size, and it became quite evident
if this ideal could be worked out, the maintenance of Army vehicles
would be a simple matter. Without some standardization, the
providing of the proper stock of spare parts became a problem of
extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>In the early summer of 1917 an appropriation of $175,000 was set
aside by the Quartermaster Department for the purpose of financing
the cost of designing and drawing up specifications for a complete
new vehicle, which would become a standardized truck for our
military forces. On August 1, 1917, there were assembled in Washington
50 automotive engineers who had been in touch with the truck
needs of the Army; and these men, with the help of Army officers,
began the task of designing a sample standardized truck, first centering
their efforts on the 3-ton size, as this was at that time most
urgently needed by the Army. On October 10 of this same year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
the engineers had finished designing the new type of truck and had
completed the first two sample trucks of this type, afterwards known
as the "Standardized B." These two sample trucks were driven to
Washington on October 19, were formally presented to the War
Department, tested, and pronounced wholly successful.</p>

<p>Orders for 10,000 of these class B trucks were placed within the
next few weeks. Five additional trucks were rushed through the
plants as a check on tools and were completed January 10, 1918.
In April, actual production having begun on the first 10,000, the
purchase of an additional 8,000 was authorized, and orders for them
were placed in May. In September, 1918, additional orders were
placed for 25,000, but on account of the signing of the armistice no
trucks were delivered under this last order.</p>

<p>Production of these standardized class B trucks was directed by
the following men, who were called to Washington: Christian Girl,
head of the Standard Parts Co., of Cleveland; James F. Bourquin,
Continental Motor Co., Louisville, Ky.; Percy W. Tracy, of the
Premier Motor Co., Indianapolis; Walter S. Quinlan, of the Maynard
H. Murch Co., Cleveland; Guy Morgan, of the Mitchell Motors
Corporation, Racine, Wis.; J. G. Utz, of the Standard Parts Co.,
Cleveland; G. W. Randels, of the Foote-Burt Co., Cleveland; and
A. G. Drefs, of the Miller-Franklin Co.</p>

<p>All materials for the building of a standardized truck were mobilized
through officials at Washington. In general, it was the idea to have
at least three or four sources of supply for each part that went into
the standardized truck, and as a result 150 parts manufacturers were
given contracts.</p>

<p>During the time in which the Quartermaster Department was
attempting to standardize all Army cargo-carrying vehicles, and up
to May 15, 1918, the other branches of the Army were buying commercial
trucks of different makes for their special uses. The Ordnance
Department had concentrated on the Nash and F. W. D.
trucks for ammunition and other ordnance work, and had ordered
approximately 30,000 of these two types. The Signal Corps had
specialized in the light and heavy aviation trucks, these being assembled
from known and tried units, such as motors, axles, transmission,
etc., and equipped with special apparatus for the Signal Corps.
Approximately 4,000 of the light aviation and 4,600 of the heavy
aviation trucks were ordered. The Engineer Corps had adopted
the Mack 5&frac12;-ton truck and had ordered approximately 3,600. The
Medical Corps had gone in for the G. M. C. model 16 for ambulances,
of which approximately 5,800 had been ordered, and they had also
purchased approximately 2,600 Ford ambulances.</p>

<p>These five branches of the Army had purchased trucks of other
makes as well, and during the winter of 1917 and 1918 it became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
evident that the buying of so many makes and from so many different
manufacturers was not a logical solution of the motor transportation
problem. Each corps had its own ideas as to the type of truck
required, and the sum of these ideas resulted in a decided lack of
standardization for the Army as a whole, and no complete standardization
for any corps as a unit.</p>

<p>During the first year of operations in France the American Expeditionary
Forces had purchased various types of vehicles abroad in
order to fill their immediate requirements, and the result was that over
200 different makes of motor vehicles were actually in use by the
American Expeditionary Forces. This diversity in types was to
some extent caused by lack of shipping space in which to transport
motor equipment abroad. Not being able to secure sufficient
trucks from the United States, due to shortage of ocean tonnage, the
American Expeditionary Forces were compelled to purchase a miscellaneous
assortment of foreign-made vehicles, thus complicating
the maintenance problem beyond the possibility of a satisfactory
solution.</p>

<p>The buying of motor equipment by so many different agencies
of the Government was not only confusing to the manufacturer, who
was selling to five different corps, but it also precluded any possibility
of real standardization; and with a view of eliminating these two
evils, Special Order 91, W. D. 1918, and General Order 38, W. D. 1918,
were issued. The first created a standardization board and the
second consolidated the procurement of all motor vehicles in the Motor
Transport Service, which service operated under the direction of the
Quartermaster General.</p>

<p>Under the special orders the standardization board was charged
with selecting and approving the proper types for the use of the Army,
the board being composed of representatives from each of the various
corps. In this manner the various ideas of the different corps were
coordinated through the discussion of the board, and the final result
was that the following chassis were standardized for use:</p>

<p>Passenger cars: light, Ford and Dodge; heavy, Cadillac.</p>

<p>Ambulances: G. M. C. and Ford (with longer wheel base).</p>

<p>Trucks: one-half-ton to &frac34;-ton, Ford and Dodge (same chassis as
in passenger cars); &frac34;-ton to 1-ton, G. M. C. Model 16; 1&frac12;-ton to 2-ton,
White; 3-ton to 5-ton, Quartermaster standardized "B."</p>

<p>The 4-wheel-drive TT type, called the "Militor," was also standardized,
this being a special truck tractor designed by the Ordnance
Department. These latter vehicles were never furnished to the
Army, as production had not progressed far enough at the time of the
signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>On this limited number of chassis could be mounted any bodies
required by the Army. For instance the White &frac34;-ton to 1-ton chassis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
could be used as a passenger car when equipped with pneumatic
tires and with the ordnance staff observation or reconnaissance body.
The Ford and Dodge chassis could be used either with the regular
passenger-car bodies or with light-delivery or light-repair bodies.
The G. M. C. chassis could be used either as an ambulance or could
be equipped with a light-cargo body, thus providing a &frac34;-ton to 1-ton
truck. The standardized "B" chassis could be used with special
machine-shop bodies, special Signal Corps apparatus, or the regular
"B" cargo body, etc. The work of the board was painstaking and
thorough, and decisions were rendered only after experts had been
consulted and exhaustive tests made.</p>

<p>While the board was standardizing on the types of vehicles to be
purchased in the future for the Army, the Motor Transport Service
was being formed, and by June 1, 1918, the consolidation of procurement,
inspection, production, maintenance, etc., was well underway.</p>

<p>The needs of the American Expeditionary Forces for motor equipment
were increasing by leaps and bounds, and the Motor Transport
Service found that it was impossible to purchase the trucks standardized
by the motorization board in sufficient quantities to meet the
overseas requirements. It was therefore decided, after the consent
of the board had been received, that certain other types of vehicles
should be procured to fill the requirements of the Army until such time
as production of the standardized truck could be increased. Therefore,
the makes of trucks which were already in use in large quantities
with the American Expeditionary Forces were temporarily made
standard to meet the immediate needs of the Army. It being
extremely difficult to purchase sufficient trucks, even of these additional
makes, to meet the needs overseas, it was decided that still
other makes of trucks would be procured for use in the United States,
thus allowing all the makes standardized for overseas use to be
shipped to France.</p>

<p>The Motor Transport Service operated from May 15 until August
15, 1918, when the Motor Transport Corps was organized under
General Order No. 75. This order created a separate corps under
the operations division of the General Staff for the operation as
well as the procurement of all passenger and cargo carrying motor
equipment for the Army. A few weeks later, however, Supply
Circular 87, P., S. &amp; T., was issued, placing the procurement of the
above under the Director of Purchase, Storage and Traffic (Motors
and Vehicles Division), but the operation and maintenance of vehicles
was left with the Motor Transport Corps. From September on
these organizations remained unchanged up to and after the signing
of the armistice.</p>

<p>The table appended shows the status of the procurement and
production of motor-vehicle orders as of November 1, 1918, 11 days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
prior to the signing of the armistice. It will be noted that there had
been ordered for delivery before July 1, 1919, a total of 185,000 trucks,
23,053 ambulances, and 38,462 passenger cars.</p>

<p>The Army in April, 1917, possessed 3,039 trucks, 437 automobiles,
670 motor cycles, and 12 tractors. One and one-half years later it
owned approximately 85,000 trucks, and had the war continued until
July 1, 1919, there would have been approximately 185,000 trucks
provided for its use by American industry. In addition, this same
industry would have provided 30,000 ambulances, 40,000 passenger
cars, 70,000 motor cycles, 70,000 bicycles, making a grand total
approaching 400,000 vehicles, costing (with spare parts) over
$700,000,000.</p>

<p>From the very beginning the Government received the hearty
cooperation of the entire industry. The need was urgent, the demand
tremendous, and many manufacturers were called upon to sacrifice
their own product in order to meet the needs of the Army, and many
were on a 100-per-cent war-work basis.</p>

<h4>MOTORCYCLES, SIDE CARS, AND BICYCLES.</h4>

<p>The need of the Army for motorcycles, side cars, and bicycles
was so tremendous that for many months during the war practically
the entire output of these vehicles of the kinds selected as
being most suitable for Army use was taken by the Government.</p>

<p>It was found that the Indian and Harley-Davidson motorcycles
were best adapted to meet the necessities of the Expeditionary
Forces in France, and these types were standardized for overseas
shipment. Orders for a total of 39,070 Indian motorcycles were
placed with the manufacturers at Springfield, Mass., and before the
end of 1918, 18,081 of these had been delivered. From the Harley-Davidson
manufacturers at Milwaukee, Wis., the Government
received 14,666 machines of the total of 26,487 ordered before the
end of 1918. In addition to the Harley-Davidson and Indian machines,
1,526 Cleveland motorcycles, made in Cleveland, Ohio, were
contracted for, and 1,476 delivered previous to 1919.</p>

<p>Side-car equipment for the Indian and Harley-Davidson machines
was bought in almost as great quantities as the motorcycles themselves.
In fact, the demand for motorcycles and side cars from these
two concerns was so great that they were working at 100-per-cent
capacity for the Government before the summer of 1918.</p>

<p>The needs of the Army for machines increased so steadily and the
requirements were so vast that both the Indian and Harley-Davidson
concerns had made large additions to their plants for meeting
the Government needs at the time the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>A standard military type of bicycle was turned out for the Army
by the Westfield Manufacturing Co., at Westfield, Mass., and other
bicycles were ordered from the Great Western Manufacturing Co.,
at Laporte, Ind., and the Davis Sewing Machine Co., at Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<h4>HORSE AND HAND DRAWN VEHICLES.</h4>

<p>It was early realized by Army officers upon our entry in the war
that procurement of horse-drawn vehicles for the Army would
require mobilization of practically the entire wagon-making industry
of the Nation. Consequently one of the first steps taken to provide
the Army with the necessary vehicles of this type was to call into
conference representatives of the four largest manufacturing companies
in the industry.</p>

<p>R. V. Board, of the Kentucky Wagon Co.; A. B. Thielens, of the
Studebaker Corporation of America; E. E. Parsonage, of the John
Deere Wagon Co.; and R. W. Lea, of the Moline Plow Co., were named
members of an advisory committee to assist the Army in the procurement
of vehicles.</p>

<p>Our first requisition called for the manufacture of 34,000 escort
wagons. This order, with the necessary spare parts for these vehicles
meant the building of the equivalent of about 50,000 wagons.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the manufacture of vehicles from
kiln-dried lumber was almost unknown, as there had always been a
sufficient amount of air-dried lumber on hand to meet every demand
for farm-wagon construction. Our first order, however, practically
used up all of the air-dried lumber then in existence in the country.
In order that dry lumber could be obtained in sufficient quantities
to keep up with the demands for Army vehicles, the War Department
entered into an arrangement by which dry-kilns were built by
contractors with the Government defraying half of the cost, the
wagon manufacturer being reimbursed at the rate of $10 for each
wagon produced, or on a basis of $10 for each $185 worth of spare
parts fabricated.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that ordinarily six months were required even with
kiln-drying before a log was ready for fabrication into a vehicle, all
orders for the War Department were filled on time and in accordance
with the plans outlined. To make this possible every manufacturer
of the industry capable of turning out the class of vehicles desired
did his part and did it so well that up to the signing of the armistice
approximately 110,000 horse-drawn or hand-drawn vehicles had been
delivered, of the total of 185,727 for which contracts had been placed.</p>

<p>Escort wagons formed the large bulk of the requirements at the
start, but as the war progressed, the necessity was created for
different designs of vehicles. So from time to time there were de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>signed
drinking-water carts and wagons, medical and ration carts,
combat wagons, veterinary ambulances, sprinkling wagons, and
various other types to meet special needs.</p>

<p>In the early spring of 1918 it was found that the wagon industry
had about reached its limit so far as output was concerned, and that,
if the war continued another year, new sources of supply would have
to be developed. Then it was that the furniture industry was called
upon to produce spare parts for vehicles. Under the presidency of P. B.
Schravesande, president of the Grand Rapids School Equipment Co.,
the Furniture and Fixture and Light-wood Industry War Service
Committee was organized to cooperate in arranging to have furniture
makers enter the field of manufacture of spare parts.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the furniture manufacturers were to produce
75 per cent of the spare parts then requisitioned, totaling in value
about $8,000,000. While the furniture industry was preparing its
plants for the manufacture of these parts, the wagon industry continued
to manufacture 25 per cent of the required parts in order to
keep up a satisfactory flow.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed practically all the furniture manufacturers
had prepared to fill the spare-parts orders, but none of them
had reached quantity production.</p>

<p>Automobile-wheel manufacturers were induced to turn out the
immense quantity of wheels needed for escort wagons.</p>

<p>There were in all about 250 manufacturers of wagons, wagon
parts, and wheels. Among the prominent wagon companies engaged
in this work were: Bain Wagon Co., Oshkosh, Wis.; Columbia
Wagon Co., Columbia, Pa.; Deere &amp; Co., Moline, Ill.; Emerson-Brantingham
Co., Rockford, Ill.; Florence Wagon Co., Florence,
Ala.; Hackney Wagon Co., Wilson, N. C.; International Harvester
Co., Memphis, Tenn.; Moline Plow Co., Moline, Ill; Mogul Wagon
Co., Hoskinsville, Ky.; Owensboro Wagon Co., Owensboro, Ky.;
Pekin Wagon Co., Pekin, Ill.; Peter Schuttler Co., Chicago, Ill.;
Springfield Wagon Co., Springfield, Mo.; Stoughton Wagon Co.,
Stoughton, Wis.; A. Streich &amp; Bros. Co., Oshkosh, Wis.; Thornhill
Wagon Co., Lynchburg, Va.; Tiffin Wagon Co., Tiffin, Ohio; Eagle
Wagon Works, Auburn, N. Y.; A. A. Cooper Wagon &amp; Buggy Co.,
Dubuque, Iowa; Winona Wagon Co., Winona, Minn.; White Hickory
Wagon Co., Atlanta, Ga.; Kentucky Wagon Co., Louisville, Ky.;
Studebaker Corporation, South Bend, Ind.; American Car &amp; Foundry
Co., Jeffersonville, Ind.</p>

<p>Among the leading automobile-wheel manufacturers who were
given contracts for escort-wagon wheels were the following: Mutual
Wheel Co., Moline, Ill.; Roger Wheel Co., Aurora, Ind.; Crane &amp;
McMahon (Inc.), St. Marys, Ohio; Hayes Wheel Co., Jackson, Mich.;
Imperial Wheel Co., Flint, Mich.; Kelsey Wheel Co., Detroit, Mich.;
Binnel Spoke &amp; Auto Wheel Co., Portland, Ind.; Archibald Wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
Co., Lawrence, Mass.; Chattanooga Wagon Co., Chattanooga, Tenn.;
Hoopes Bros. &amp; Dalington (Inc.), Westchester, Pa.; Prudden Wheel Co.,
Lansing, Mich.; Standard Wheel Co., Terre Haute, Ind.; Avoca
Wheel Co., Avoca, N. Y.; New Wapakoneta Wheel Co., Wapakoneta,
Ohio; Piedmont Wagon Co., Hickory, N. C.</p>

<p>Furniture factories that assumed contracts for making spare parts
for horse-drawn vehicles included about 30 furniture manufacturers
of Rockford, Ill., as well as the following: Grand Rapids School
Equipment Co., Grand Rapids, Mich.; Sherman Bros. Co., Jamestown,
N. Y.; Ramsey-Alton Manufacturing Co., Portland, Mich.;
Connersville Furniture Co., Connersville, Ind.; P. Derby &amp; Co.,
Gardner, Mass.; Ebert Furniture Co., Red Lion, Pa.; S. Karpen &amp;
Bros., Chicago, Ill.; Chas. T. Lambert &amp; Co., Holland, Mich.; The
Macey Co., Grand Rapids, Mich.; Thos. Madden Son &amp; Co., Indianapolis,
Ind.; Sidney Manufacturing Co., Sidney, Ohio; Basic Furniture
Co., Waynesboro, Va.; Brecht Co., St. Louis, Mo.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

MEDICAL AND DENTAL SUPPLIES.</h3>


<p>Lest it be thought that the American Army was dependent in
any way for its hospital facilities and surgical supplies upon private
contributions, it may be said that the Government during the period
between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918, placed contracts
for medical supplies amounting to $424,761,031. Contract cancellations
after the armistice was signed amounted to $56,000,000.
The remaining $370,000,000 approximately represents the cost to
the United States of medicine, surgical instruments and dressings,
ambulances, hospital furniture, equipment and supplies, and dental
and veterinary supplies for the war.</p>

<p>This was considerably more money than was contributed by the
American people to the American Red Cross, a great part of whose
funds went to the relief of civilian populations in Europe, or to any
other war charity. Thus it will be seen that the Government with
billions of dollars to spend could well afford the few hundreds of
millions necessary to give the American soldiers who needed it the
best possible hospital attention. It accepted the gifts of this sort,
ranging from gauze bandages to fully equipped motor ambulances,
as the offerings of the people whose hearts overflowed with love and
gratitude to the American soldiers and took this means of showing
their concern; but the Government in no sense was dependent upon
these donations.</p>

<p>Before 1914 four-fifths of all surgical instruments used in the
United States were imported from Germany. This country, too,
was practically dependent upon Germany for many of its most
important medicines, including the potassium salts and such drugs
as digitalin, salvarsan, atropin, etc. While in a way we had been
developing substitute sources of supply in the United States for
these indispensable commodities in the months between the outbreak
of the great war and the date of our participation in it, the raising
of a vast army and the project to send this army to the bloody battle
fields of France created an American demand for medicines and
surgical instruments beyond anything ever known in the United
States. Yet, through the cooperation of manufacturers and the
officers of the Medical Department's general purchasing office,
which was on November 15, 1918, incorporated in the office of the
Director of Purchase and Storage, sufficient supplies were developed,
not only of medicine but of surgical instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>The development of the production of medicines for the use of
troops in the field was particularly notable. The important drug,
salvarsan, used in the treatment of syphilis, was a patented formula
and had been furnished formerly by a single German manufacturer.
In this country we produced arsphenamine as a substitute, gradually
increasing the supply and constantly improving the drug until
at length its toxicity had been so reduced that it equaled or even
excelled the German product.</p>

<p>The facilities of the American drug and tablet manufacturers
were taxed to the utmost to supply the Army. For example, during
the year 1918 a total of 46,000,000 quinine tablets was produced,
while 172,000,000 aspirin tablets were manufactured during the same
period, and 835,000 pounds of calomel ointment, 45,000,000 iodine
swabs, 10,250,000 tins of foot powder, and 300,000,000 tubes of
iodine-potassium. All other items of medicines, antiseptics, and disinfectants,
required by the Medical Department, were increased in
proportion. This production not only strained the facilities of the
manufacturers of chemicals and drugs but also called upon the
glassware manufacturers for the necessary bottles and tubes in which
to pack these medicines satisfactorily. Here again was an effort
that required close cooperation between the trade and the Medical
Department in order to meet the demand.</p>

<p>When it became evident that a declaration of war against Germany
was imminent, the Medical Department proceeded to analyze the
country's resources of medical supplies. These resources were to a
large extent limited. The Allied nations had been making heavy
and constant demands for these materials, so much so that even the
mobilization of such a relatively small number of troops as were
centered along the Mexican Border put a severe burden upon
the medical supply facilities of the country.</p>

<p>The Council of National Defense took up the medical supplies
problem at the outset. The various manufacturers sent their representatives
to consult with the Surgeon General, and committees on
surgical instruments, surgical dressings, medicines, and other important
supplies were formed. These committees allocated among
the various manufacturers the first emergency orders for these
materials. The result was that the base hospitals at the 32 mobilization
camps in 1917 were equipped in an amazingly short time.
The New York Medical Supply Depot, which was then the largest
purchasing agent, was called upon to supply 500 hospital beds
each to 22 of the camps. This work was handled so rapidly that in
some cases the shipments had to be held back to wait for the completion
of the hospital buildings.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult task was to determine what quantities of
medical supplies would be needed for a given period. It is a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>paratively
simple matter to estimate the quantity of clothing necessary
for a certain number of troops, or to figure what food they will
require; but it is not possible to forecast the number of men who will
be sick at a given camp at a specified time, nor is it possible to foretell
the nature of diseases or injuries. An epidemic of measles or mumps
requires different treatment than an epidemic of influenza, and makes
necessary the use of a different variety of medical supplies. Experience
sheets of supplies actually used in the past formed the basis
of our requirements schedules.</p>

<p>Eventually there was worked out a system of supply based on the
initial requirements of the unit of 25,000 men in the Expeditionary
Forces and the automatic supply of replenishment of this equipment.
In this system use was made of the knowledge and experience obtained
by the British and French medical forces during their nearly
three years of warfare before America went in.</p>

<p>The following statement of estimated expenditures for the fiscal
year 1920 illustrates the difference in the medical requirements of an
army of 500,000 men under peace conditions and an army of 5,000,000
men in a war such as the recent one:</p>

<p>Civilian experts in various lines of medical supplies were brought
into the organization to supply the wide range of specialized knowledge
required in such a universal buying program as the Medical
Department was about to conduct. Before the war the Army's
purchases of instruments for oral and brain surgery, orthopedic
supplies, Dakin outfits, and other special apparatus were practically
negligible. During the war period these purchases amounted to
millions of dollars. It may be seen readily that the purchasing
office had to possess more than a superficial understanding of the
materials to be bought.</p>

<p>Orders customarily went to the lowest bidders, with a careful
review in Washington of all prices named in contracts. The inspection
of material was an important phase of the work. This inspection
was handled through the New York Medical Supply Depot, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
called in as assistants the United States Board of Customs Appraisers
at New York City. That corps of men had had long years of experience
in inspecting and determining the value of surgical supplies,
as most of these supplies in the past had come through the customhouse
from foreign countries. The inspection of drugs was handled
by the Medical Department's laboratories, the Army Medical School,
and by the Bureau of Standards, which rendered valuable assistance
in examining and testing samples. In addition the Medical Department
maintained a corps of inspectors to travel from one factory to
another, keeping in close touch with the progress and assisting in
procuring raw materials and expediting deliveries.</p>

<p>The medical supplies were divided under the following classifications:</p>


<ul class="index"><li>(<i>a</i>) Hospital equipment, such as beds, bedside tables, enamelware, etc.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Surgical dressings.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Surgical instruments.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Medicines, antiseptics, and disinfectants.</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Field supplies (chests and units for extended field service).</li>
<li>(<i>f</i>) Dental supplies.</li>
<li>(<i>g</i>) Veterinary supplies.</li>
<li>(<i>h</i>) Laboratory supplies.</li>
<li>(<i>i</i>) Motor ambulance supplies.</li>
<li>(<i>j</i>) X-ray supplies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The New York depot was intrusted with the purchase of miscellaneous
hospital equipment and dental and X-ray supplies. The
St. Louis depot purchased the veterinary supplies, and the field
medical supply depot at Washington purchased the laboratory and
field supplies. The motor ambulance supply depot, established at
Louisville, Ky., purchased ambulances and ambulance spare parts.
Appreciating the necessity for a certain amount of cooperation where
the purchase of conflicting articles by the various depots was concerned,
the general purchasing office of the Medical Department was
organized at Washington. This purchasing office bought all surgical
dressings, surgical instruments, and medicines and such items as were
used in the field, post, veterinary, and dental stations.</p>

<p>In connection with the production of surgical instruments in this
country it was necessary for the Medical Department to educate in
the manufacture of these instruments certain concerns which had
been engaged in the production of similar devices. Men skilled in the
manufacture of instruments, with long years of experience, were sent
to these factories to work out with the forces there satisfactory
processes. It was necessary to recruit toolmakers, jewelers, and
cutlery manufacturers in order to build up a sufficient supply of
forged and finished instruments.</p>

<p>Surgical needles, for instance, had never been made in this country,
but had all been obtained in England. As a war measure the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Government placed this item on its list of restricted exports. After
long and continued effort the general purchasing office developed
American sources of supply of needles with remarkable success.</p>

<p>In one month we shipped 65 tons of surgical instruments to France.
A few of the principal instruments, quantities purchased, and the
prices paid were as follows:</p>

    <td>1.35</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Each general operating case contains more than 50 instruments
and the small operating case more than 30 instruments, and in these
two items alone are more than 207,000 forgings, practically all
handwork.</p>

<p>The quantity of surgical dressings used in peace times was relatively
small, so that the sources for supplying this material had to be
increased enormously. To do this the Government went out into
the cotton goods industry and induced such concerns as curtain
makers and manufacturers of waists and white goods to make bandages
for surgical uses. The Government obtained the raw material,
gray gauze, and turned it over to the various manufacturers for
bleaching, cutting, sterilizing, and packing in the necessary cartons.</p>

<p>Among other items during the last year of the war a total of
12,000,000 individual dressing packets were purchased and 795,000
boxes of gauze bandages, 574,400,000 yards of bandage, 10,000,000
first-aid packets, and 108,000,000 yards of gauze. During the same
period a total quantity of 3,814,000 pounds of absorbent cotton was
also bought.</p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous items obtained were approximately
1,600,000 blankets, 258,000 litters, and over 1,000,000 clinical thermometers.
The rate of output of clinical thermometers was not
all that the Medical Department thought it should be, and as a result
a large quantity of thermometers was obtained on mandatory orders.</p>

<p>The heaviest buying period during the war was between July 1 and
November 30, 1918. The supplies purchased or ordered in that
period were the following, with their costs:</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the purchases made in France for the
Medical Department consisted mostly of large and bulky items,
mainly hospital furniture and equipment, which, if transported from
the United States, would necessitate the use of considerable valuable
cargo space. Foreign purchases were made primarily to save ship
space and not because of any shortage or failure to function in this
country.</p>

<p>Although America is famous throughout the world for her dentists
and dentistry, yet the participation of this country in the war created
a demand for dental supplies that the American manufacturing facilities
in existence in 1917 were unable to fill. For that reason it was
necessary to extend the production capacity. The manufacturers in
the trade rose to the occasion, and as a result the Government was
able to supply to the A. E. F. from the United States all dental
materials required, the only purchases made in France being of
exceedingly bulky apparatus.</p>

<p>The total amount allotted for dental supplies for an army of
5,000,000 men in 1919 was $6,256,482. During the five months
between July 1 and November 30, 1918, the dental purchases
amounted to approximately $5,000,000.</p>

and the quantity and cost of each were as follows:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

SALVAGE.</h3>


<p>Tables of statistics are apt to be tiresome affairs; but in the annals
of the War Department, as part of the record of the American Army
in the great war, there is a table of statistics that is replete with
human interest. This is the table which depicts the activities of the
salvage operations of the Army, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Until the war came to America and brought to us the necessity of
being provident, thrift and economy could not be called characteristic
American qualities. As virtues in the individual we were apt to
despise them. Paris can live on what New York throws away, runs
the old saying. For the prudent man we invented opprobrious
names. Such names and phrases were but the surface outcroppings
of a national tendency to be wasteful.</p>

<p>But the war came along to put a stop to waste and to raise thrift
high in the esteem of America. Partly because of the mounting
prices of food and clothing and partly because of well-organized
and well-conducted propaganda on the part of various agencies of
the Government, chief among them being the United States Food
Administration and the Liberty Bond and War Saving Stamp
organizations of the Treasury Department, America began to practice
economy in the use of materials.</p>

<p>How much of the credit for the change can be claimed by the
Government itself we may never know; but this may be said&mdash;in
urging the people to save materials in their own homes, the Government
did not, as it had done in previous wars, allow the traditional
wastes of military campaigns. The Government practiced what it
preached. It cleaned up its own back yard and utilized every scrap
of useful material. It mended the shoes and clothing of the Army;
it darned the socks; it tinkered the tin cans; it starved the garbage
pails by economy in the mess kitchens and recovered the valuable
components of garbage at rendering plants; it collected the junk;
it swept the stables and put the manure on the land, and then produced
crops from the increased fertility. All of these adventures
in conservation and reclamation were known to the Army simply as
Salvage; which after all was but the scientific attention which the
Army paid to the "p's" and "q's" of military housekeeping&mdash;it was
household economy on the scale of a family of 3,500,000 members.</p>

<p>The figures of the Army's thrift are most impressive. The figures
of our war salvage are as follows:</p>

<p>A consolidation of these figures shows that the total amount returned
to the Government in money value by the savings of the salvage
service of the Army for the single calendar year of 1918 was $101,180,151.
With this figure some interesting comparisons may be made.</p>

<p>In 1912, to meet every expense of the American standing Army,
Congress appropriated $99,676,767.43; in 1913 the appropriations were
$100,292,855.04. Salvage, reclaiming the materials once wasted and
using them over again, saved enough in 1918 to have maintained the
entire Military Establishment in 1912 or 1913.</p>

<p>But there is even a more striking comparison. During the fiscal
year of 1898&mdash;the Spanish-American War year&mdash;the entire appropriations
for the support of the Army amounted to $70,394,739.96.
Salvage in 1918 saved $30,000,000 more than was appropriated to
fight the Spanish-American War up to July 1, 1898, at which date
the fighting was nearly over.</p>

<p>Take the cost of clothing the Army raised to fight against Spain,
and add to it the appropriations for clothing the Army and equipping
it with shoes, leather and rubber goods, and textile equipment for the
years 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, and you have a total Government
expenditure of $100,050,271.65. The savings of salvage in 1918
could pay this entire cost with $1,129,880 to spare.</p>

<p>It cost $20,280,000 for the clothing and equipage of the Army for
the year ending June 30, 1917, at which date the war with Germany
had begun. Salvage in the United States alone in 1918 saved to the
Government $17,967,416 more than this appropriation.</p>

<p>Salvage undertakings touched intimately every soldier in the Army.
This service which taught economy in the use of materials could
with equal facility operate a laundry or dry-cleaning plant, or run a
farm, or drive a good bargain in the sale of junk, or return goods
that did not meet specifications and be reimbursed for them.</p>

<p>Wherever the experts of the service saw a leak through which the
Government's money might flow out, they plugged it. An innovation
in warfare as we knew it, it had to fight its way against prejudice
at the start, but it developed what formerly was waste and a liability
into a tremendous asset. Yet when the armistice came salvage had
only commenced to show its possibilities. It had merely scratched
the surface, but it had opened up unlimited fields for utilizing worn-out
or unserviceable products or by-products of war. It had saved
thousands of tons of shipping space in the transportation of supplies
to the American Expeditionary Forces by using over again in France
the things that otherwise would have had to be replaced by new; it
saved this tonnage at the time when every ton saved counted heavily.
In this and in the saving of materials at a time when all the raw
materials of the earth would scarcely meet the insatiable demands of
Moloch, the value of salvage can scarcely be measured by the money
figures of its record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span></p>


<h4>SALVAGE IN THE UNITED STATES.</h4>

<p>War salvage in the United States started on October 5, 1917, when
the conservation branch was created in the Quartermaster Department.
It started with an executive force of two commissioned
officers and one stenographer. When the armistice was signed about
13 months later, the salvage service in the United States alone had a
force of approximately 500 commissioned officers, 20,000 enlisted
men, and 2,000 civilian employees.</p>

<p>In this period the method of clothing and feeding the American
soldier had been revolutionized. The old way was to issue a uniform
to a soldier and hold him responsible for the repair and cleaning of it.
He owned his uniform and had to keep it in good condition at his own
expense out of the $15 per month the Government paid him. The
new way was for the Government itself to retain ownership of the
uniform and to repair and clean it at public expense. The soldier
was required to pay only for his laundry work at a uniform charge of
$1 per month, much under what he would have had to pay at commercial
rates.</p>

<p>Formerly the soldier had to repair his own shoes. The soldier
prefers repaired shoes to new ones for campaign service because the
former are broken in and are comfortable. After the salvage service
was established the Government retained ownership of Army shoes
and repaired them at Government expense.</p>

<p>Once the Army seldom conducted sales of the boxes and crates in
which supplies were packed. Salvage undertook such sales, thereby
bringing considerable revenue to the Army.</p>

<p>But in these and similar economies, it was not so much the saving
of money that was important as it was the saving of materials at a
time when the supply of all materials was scarcely adequate to the
war demands. When our troops first reached France the officers
were surprised at the emphasis placed upon salvage operations by
the British and French armies. They were soon to learn that
salvage was stressed because it supplied materials which were scarce.
Glycerine, a component of high explosives, had become so short in
supply that the British Ministry of Munitions paid as much as $1,250
a ton for it. The British army distilled its garbage and procured
from the operation glycerine at a cost of $250 per ton. This was a
financial saving of $1,000 a ton; but, more important, it supplied
glycerine at the time when money did not count. The British
Ministry of Munitions got the glycerine, which meant explosives for
use against the Germans, which was the main thing.</p>

<p>The British appreciated the importance of salvage so much that
one of the officers sent with the British mission to the United States
early in the war was a salvage expert, included in the mission so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
that we might early have the benefit of the British experience in
this work.</p>

<p>Although the salvage service of America was authorized in the
autumn of 1917, it was not until winter was declining into the spring
of 1918 that the service became a working organization fully
clothed with authority. Consequently its record was accomplished
within a period of 9 or 10 months. The purpose and ideals of the
service were embodied in its code, known as special regulations No. 77,
promulgating rules and regulations for the conservation and reclamation
of Army supplies and materials. The principal provisions of
these regulations were as follows:</p>


<ul class="index"><li>(<i>a</i>) The repair of clothing and equipage.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Laundering and dry cleaning of clothing and equipage.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Supervision of contracts for the renovation of clothing and equipage.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) The development of agricultural, mineral, and forest lands for the benefit of the Army.</li>

<li>(<i>e</i>) The organization, discipline, and training of men of special units, companies, battalions, and regiments for salvage work.</li>
</ul>

<p>These regulations likewise&mdash;</p>


<ul class="index"><li>(<i>a</i>) Created salvage companies of 7 officers and 588 enlisted men each, based on a camp strength of 27,000 troops where all salvage utilities exist.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Provided methods of receiving and disposing of clothing and equipage turned in for renovation.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) Provided methods for the conservation of food and the reduction of waste through a systematic check on the disposal of garbage.</li>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Fixed the responsibility of organization in connection with salvage work.</li>

<li>(<i>e</i>) Provided definite rules and instructions to be followed by organization commanders and their commands in the care of clothing and equipage in order that the cost of maintenance might be reduced to a minimum and that usefulness might be conserved to the utmost, consistent with the health and well being of the troops.</li>

<li>(<i>f</i>) Provided a basis for the operation and financing of camp laundries and dry-cleaning plants operated in connection with base salvage plants.</li>

<li>(<i>g</i>) Provided a uniform monthly laundry charge of $1 per enlisted man at each camp and station where there was a Government-operated laundry, as well as a uniform charge for service rendered to officers, civilians, hospitals, and other camp agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus it may be seen that special regulations No. 77 were not only
a charter for the salvage service but a code of conduct in economy
and thrift for the soldier of the American Army. Although the regulations
did not become official until midsummer of 1918, they had a
profound effect in the few months before the fighting in Europe
came to an end.</p>

<p>Prior to July 1, 1918, all reports of garbage collection, etc., in the
military camps in this country indicated that the American soldier
in training wasted on the average of 2 pounds of food per day. This
was not excessive, judged by civilian standards, since our large
cities, a great part of whose population are fed not nearly so well as
soldiers were fed in the camps, show a food waste nearly as great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
But the camp waste of food was regarded as excessive by the salvage
officers. Special regulations No. 77 contained minute directions for
conserving food in the camp kitchens. The result of these regulations
was that in the four-month period beginning July 1, 1918, the average
mess waste per man in the camps fell to 0.3 of a pound per day.
Since there was an average strength of 1,500,000 men in training
during these four months, the reduction of waste amounted to many
thousands of tons of food.</p>

<p>These regulations also set up a salvage equipment for the use of
the Army. As a rule each camp had a shoe-repair shop large enough
to fix 400 to 500 pairs of shoes per day; a clothing-repair shop large
enough to take care of the everyday mending of 30,000 troops; a
hat-repair shop sufficient in size to restore the headgear of 30,000
men; and other miscellaneous shops.</p>

<p>But at the change of seasons there could be expected an exceptionally
large turn in of worn-out clothing, and to handle these
periodical floods of garments large base salvage plants were established
at Fort Sam Houston, Tex.; Washington, D. C.; Atlanta, Ga.;
New York City; Philadelphia; El Paso; and Newport News, Va.;
with a base salvage plant for rejuvenating shoes at Jeffersonville,
Ind. Smaller base plants were established at Chicago, New Orleans,
San Francisco, and at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at
Fort Leavenworth, Kans., and at Alcatraz Island, Calif. Other
base plants to receive and classify and dispose of waste materials
were established at New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago,
St. Louis, Fort Sam Houston, and Atlanta.</p>

<p>The shoe-salvage base plant at Jeffersonville Depot was more
than a repair shop in the accepted sense of the term, for it became
one of the most complete shoe factories to be found anywhere in the
country. When this shop was being projected as a plant to take
care of the overflow of worn shoes from the camps and depots, the
United Shoe Machinery Co. agreed to furnish machinery sufficient
to repair 2,000 pairs of shoes a day, supplying this equipment for a
period of six months without any expense to the Government,
except upkeep and the cost of supplies.</p>

<p>At the Jeffersonville shop shoes went through the mill from department
to department much as machines are assembled in the familiar
quantity-production manner. Shoes arriving were first counted, and
then sorted and graded as follows:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>Class 1. Unrepairable.</li>

<li>Class 2. Inner soles required.</li>

<li>Class 3. Regular run of repairs (half soles or full soles, heels, patching of uppers,
and other minor repairs).</li>

<li>Class 4. Civilian.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p>The shoes arriving at this plant were in a condition that would
have resulted in their being discarded altogether in the old days.
The experience at Jeffersonville showed that 65 of each 100 pairs arriving
at the factory could be repaired, and repaired cheaply. In
January, 1919, of 132,112 pairs of shoes sorted, 45,000 were in irreparable
condition and had to be thrown away. There were 11,475
pairs of class 2 shoes, 74,362 pairs of class 3, and 1,175 pairs of class 4.</p>

<p>From the sorting room the shoes went to the wash room, where
they were disinfected and cleaned in a bath containing a solution of
40 ounces of formaldehyde and 1 pound of castile soap to each 10
gallons of water. After being washed the shoes were placed on rolling
racks, each rack holding 24 pairs of the same size and width.
The loaded racks were wheeled to the lasting section where lasts
were inserted according to sizes.</p>

<p>Next, machines cut off the worn portions of the old heels, after
which the shoes went to the stripping bench, where the old soles
were removed and the shank pieces skived to prepare a smooth joint
for the new half sole. The next process was welting. The welts
were prepared, and tarred felt was glued to the old inner sole to fill
out uneven parts and prevent squeaking. The next operation was
to lay on the half sole in a setting of rubber cement. Another machine
rough rounded the soles to conform with the shape of the shoes.</p>

<p>Then the shoes reached the stitching machines, where the soles
were sewed on, and then the leveling machines, which smoothed out
the wrinkles of the inner soles. The next step brought them to the
heeling machines, where the complete heels were attached in one motion.
Next, machinery for nailing soles and heels, and then the
trimming machinery for smoothing off the work. The final mechanical
operation was on the scouring and finishing machines. Meanwhile,
if the shoes needed patching on the uppers, this work was done
by women operating sewing machines.</p>

<p>The final process was to give the field shoe a thorough coat of waterproof
dubbin. A good polish was put on the russet shoes. A split
leather insole was inserted in each shoe to insure perfect smoothness
of the bottom. A pair of laces was tied to each pair of shoes, and
then the shoes were packed in boxes of 24 pairs each and turned in to
the Army stores.</p>

<p>The Jeffersonville shop repaired 222,135 pairs of shoes in seven
months of operation. Thousands of pairs of shoes were discovered
to have been fitted too short. This was shown by the fact that many
of the shoes were worn out entirely in the toes. A shoe that is too
long will turn up at the toes, while one that is too short will stub with
nearly every step taken.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1918, the Secretary of War authorized the expenditure
of $5,287,852 for the construction of laundries to serve from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
20,000 to 40,000 men in each of 20 camps and posts. About this
same time repair shops were authorized at each of the training camps
and special dry-cleaning plants at Atlanta, Fort Sam Houston, El
Paso, and Alcatraz Island. Before the armistice was signed many
of these plants were in operation. In addition to these the salvage
service eventually operated printing plants, wagon repair shops, and
carpentry shops, so that at the time the armistice was signed there
was hardly anything of quartermaster issue not subject to rehabilitation
by the salvage division.</p>

<p>Each shoe-repair shop at the training camps had equipment
sufficient to repair 500 pairs of shoes per day, utilizing the services
of 40 to 50 men. When the shops were officially authorized, an inventory
of the Army's old shoes showed there were approximately
1,500,000 pairs on hand in need of rehabilitation. In order to assist
the camp shops in the work, the salvage service brought between
50 and 55 shoe factories into the reclamation effort, these private
factories repairing about 500,000 pairs until the camp shops were
able to catch up.</p>

<p>Because of the shortage of linen thread it was decided to use nails
for attaching half soles, particularly in the repair shops in France.
More than 2,500 nailing machines were bought and shipped to the
American Expeditionary Forces. The American Expeditionary
Forces adopted the English system of company cobblers and regimental
repair shops. Upward of 11,000 cobblers' kits were shipped to
France. In July, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces requested
machinery for a base shoe-repair plant in France. This machinery
was shipped considerably before hostilities ceased.</p>

<p>The service maintained a corps of civilian instructors, who traveled
from camp to camp and improved the efficiency of the Army
cobbling. The accumulation of worn shoes at the embarkation
camps was sent to various contractors for repairs. By November,
1918, the shoe-repair facilities of the Army had reached full operation,
500,000 pairs of shoes being repaired that month, a figure representing
all the repairing required by 1,500,000 men. All shoe-repairing
activities were under the direction of Philip H. Fraher,
who was assisted by Joseph Caunt, of Pasadena, Calif., a retired shoe
manufacturer with a wide experience both in this country and in
England.</p>

<p>In its clothing-repair activities the salvage service dry-cleaned
uniforms and woolen equipment, repaired and renovated hats, and
reclaimed outer clothing and underclothing.</p>

<p>For the first time in dry-cleaning history, a method was worked
out to destroy all living organisms and a considerable amount of
bacteria, a process which is likely to have a lasting effect in the dry-cleaning
industry. The specifications of this process were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
result of cooperative laboratory research by the Bureau of Standards,
the Public Health Service, and the salvage division. In addition
to destroying germs and bacteria the process also thoroughly cleansed
the garments. Experts from the salvage division were on hand to
see to it that the various contractors lived up to the standard specifications.
The authorized Government-owned dry-cleaning plants,
which were to be the last word in what such establishments should
be, were not completed, due to the signing of the armistice. Dr.
Harry E. Mechling, a graduate physician and president of the Swiss
Cleaners &amp; Dyers, of Louisville, Ky., was in charge of the Army's
dry-cleaning activities.</p>

<p>In the repair of clothing the service received much assistance from
the Red Cross. Local Red Cross units in the vicinity of camps
worked in conjunction with the officers of the salvage service in the
reclamation of such garments as woolen shirts, underclothing,
sweaters, helmets, socks, and gloves.</p>

<p>The base salvage plants at Atlanta and Fort Sam Houston reached
a high state of efficiency in the repair of clothing. Shipment after
shipment was made from such congested centers as Newport News
and Hoboken to these plants, and within a comparatively short time
the property was ready for reshipment and reissue. Capt. Harvey A.
Rosenthal, a graduate of the first officers' training school, and in
civil life in the clothing business, was in charge of clothing repairs.</p>

<p>All of the camps had shops for renovating and repairing hats.
The average cost for repairing a hat was 35 cents, whereas the lowest
contract price was 65 cents, and the quality of work at the Government
shops was far better than that obtained from private contractors.</p>

<p>The following table gives an idea of the approximate saving to
the Government in hat-repair operations:</p>

<p>Mr. E. Leroy Cummings, of the John B. Stetson Co., of Philadelphia,
was in charge of hat-repair activities.</p>

<p>Extensive repairs to canvas materials were confined to the base
plants at Philadelphia, El Paso, Fort Sam Houston, and Atlanta, and,
on a smaller scale, at Jeffersonville. Minor repairs were conducted
at camp shops, some of which were only in the course of construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
when the armistice was signed. Tents were generally reconditioned
while standing. Patches to tents were attached by means of a
nitrocellulose cement, the best cement for the purpose which the
salvage service found, being called vanite. Experiments at the
Bureau of Chemistry resulted in the adoption of three waterproofing
compounds named Preservol, Candeline, and Truscon. These compounds
were applied to both standing tents and tents which had been
taken down, with complete and effective results.</p>

<p>Laundering was not a new activity for the War Department, since
when the war was declared the Government already owned 14 small
steam laundries. Later the Government went into the laundry
business on the scale demanded by the great chain of training camps,
building cantonment laundries at a cost of approximately $300,000
each. Experienced laundrymen were placed in charge of camp
laundries. Through the cooperation with the Government's insect
experts of the Bureau of Entomology, laundering processes were
worked out successfully to disinfect all clothing while washing it
and to free it from vermin without shrinking fabrics or causing other
damage. Government laundries during the war operated 24 hours
per day with three labor shifts and cleaned an average of 10,909,850
pieces of clothing monthly, with gross receipts of over $500,000 per
month, approximately half of which was profit.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of laundry activity was the
development of mobile laundry units for overseas use near the front.
The men to operate these units were trained in a special school at
Camp Meigs, D. C. Each mobile unit required a crew of 37 men.
The men of the Army nicknamed these special troops the "Fighting
Chinamen."</p>

<p>The need of the American Expeditionary Forces for wash-up and
delousing stations at the front, so that even troops engaged in battle
might have clean clothes, called the mobile laundry units into being.
The first experimental equipment was designed and constructed
early in 1918. After that the salvage service produced 50 others,
32 of which were shipped to France.</p>

<p>Each unit consisted of a large steam tractor and four trailers, an
outfit which on the road made up a train over 100 feet long. The
trailers could be placed together in the field to form a building 30
feet long and 28 feet wide, the tractor acting as the power plant.
On the trailers were washing machines, wringers, drying machines,
tanks for water and soap, a pump, and a dynamo to supply electric
lights. One of these plants working 24 hours per day could do the
washing of 10,000 men. This unit was designed by officers of the
salvage division.</p>

<p>Army laundry activity was in charge of three New York laundrymen:
J. E. Dann, president of the Pilgrim Laundry, of Brooklyn,
and his assistants, William Longfelder, of H. Kohnstamn &amp; Co., and
E. D. Tribbett, of the American Laundry Machinery Co.</p>

<p>Wherever possible waste materials were reclaimed for use by the
Army instead of being sold as junk. This was particularly true of
bags and burlap. Hundreds of thousands of bags and great quantities
of burlap furnished by the salvage division were utilized for
army purposes. Without salvage, all of this would have been thrown
away or sold at junk prices. When the fighting ended the base
salvage plant at Chicago was being equipped to repair about 15,000
bags daily.</p>

<p>The purpose of garbage separation was threefold&mdash;the reduction
of mess waste, the increase in revenue to the Government, and the
recovery of glycerine contents for military purposes. Before the
war with Germany the Army regulations required the burning of
garbage at camps. When the great training camps were established,
the Government adopted generally the policy of selling garbage
to contractors, except at Camps Fremont, Hancock, McClellan,
Sevier, and Shelby, where it was incinerated. Originally contracts
had been let on a per-man basis, the contracts extending for several
months, comparable to municipal contracts for the disposal of
garbage. Later on, however, the policy was adopted of letting contracts
for periods of one month only, since the number of men at the
camps was continually increasing, and the garbage grew correspondingly
bulkier. It is estimated that this change in contracting saved
the Government considerably over $400,000. Contract sale prices
ranged from 1 cent to 9 cents per man per month, the latter price in
most cases including the manure from the stables.</p>

<p>With a view to obtaining glycerine, the War Department authorized
the construction of 16 garbage-rendering plants at the larger
concentration centers, but only one, that at Camp Lee, was actually
constructed, since it was determined later by an investigation of our
national resources that the amount of glycerine to be obtained in
this manner did not justify the expenditure of the money. Also the
project of establishing piggeries at camps was abandoned, after
investigation by the salvage service, since it would have required
18 months to clear the investment, and in the meantime the Government
would have been deprived of revenue from the sale of garbage.</p>

<p>The disposition of waste materials was under the direction of
Louis Birkenstein, of Chicago, assisted by R. D. Cunningham, of
Troy, N. Y.</p>

<p>In response to an insistent demand that farms be operated at various
camps, the salvage division, on May 15, 1918, secured $60,000
from the vocational fund for the training of soldiers and allotted
sums to 15 camps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span></p>

<p>On November 4, 1918, Congress appropriated $250,000 for the
same purpose, but little of this money was expended. The total
acreage under cultivation in 1918 was 3,483, and the equivalent revenue
derived from the camp farms amounted to $108,000. The farm
work was under the direction of Capt. Henry G. Parsons, a practical
and scientific farmer.</p>

<p>Salvage activities, in general, in the United States were under the
direction of Philip W. Wrenn, who was chief of the salvage division
during the most active period of its existence.</p>


<h4>SALVAGE IN FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Salvage in France was under the direction of the chief quartermaster
with the American Expeditionary Forces. At first, it was undertaken
in a smattering way, but as the American Army grew in size, salvage
increased, until the salvage service became one of the features in the
field, with thousands of men and women working in salvage activities,
with salvage plants, branches, and depots, large and small, saving,
repairing, conserving, and putting into shape, ready for reissue, materials
of all sorts and descriptions. The word "salvage" became the
watchword and pride of many an organization at the front.</p>

<p>Each field army had its chief salvage officer. Each division of
troops had its salvage organization under a salvage officer. Each
organization had its salvage dump, in which it took a just pride,
and there was a spirit of friendly rivalry between different organizations
as to which could save the most for the Government.</p>

<p>In the flood times of battle, when waste materials piled up on
the fields, the regular salvage specialists were assisted in various
ways. In some divisions the regimental bands were designated to
act as emergency salvage companies. Sometimes after an engagement
whole battalions and regiments were enlisted to clean up an
area, and there is one instance on record where a wise general of the
American Expeditionary Forces turned out his entire field army
to clean up for salvage the area which it had just won from the
enemy. The salvage service in France handled not only the recovery
of quartermaster supplies, but it also collected and disposed of
all materials captured from the enemy, including ordnance materials,
and also all materials abandoned by our own troops and found
on the battle fields. When troops moved into combat they took
with them only such equipment as they could carry on their backs
or on the meager transportation facilities allowed. Thus they frequently
left behind them an enormous quantity of their possessions;
including personal baggage. The salvage units went through such
areas, visited every billet, and collected all Government and personal
property and cared for it. As an indication of the magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
of this work, there was one salvage dump in France 40 acres in area
piled as high as goods could be thrown from trucks.</p>

<p>The salvage operations in France were conducted over an area of
4,000 square miles, and there were approximately 4,000 men in the
salvage service field force. The various salvage depots and shops
in France occupied a floor space of 736,000 square feet and had a
personnel of 11,632 on December 31, 1918. Even before the war,
the Quartermaster Corps of the Army was a good-sized organization,
yet there were more French women and girls mending clothing for
the American Army in France at one time than there were commissioned
officers and enlisted men in the whole Quartermaster Service
before the war.</p>

<p>Clothing generally for the American troops in France was repaired
at special shops and at the homes of seamstresses in the small towns
and communes. Each town had a forewoman who distributed the
damaged clothing, after it had been disinfected and laundered, and
kept all counts. There were 880 of these home workers, nearly
all of them from needy families. The best record for darning socks
was made by an old French grandm&eacute;re, aged more than 80.</p>

<p>Numerous soldiers were discovered in the American Expeditionary
Forces who were unfit physically for the hard service on the front
line. These were permitted to go into the various salvage depots
and shops, where they learned to be shoemakers, harness makers,
saddle makers, wood workers, painters, metal workers, tailors,
laundrymen, electricians, mechanics, checkers, warehousemen, etc.,
occupations in which many of them expected to engage after their
separation from the military service.</p>

<p>The salvage troops in France were in five classes&mdash;the salvage
headquarter detachments, depot battalions, field salvage battalions,
laundry units, and the clothing and bathing units. One of the last
named was attached to each division to handle field bathhouses
and delousing and disinfecting plants, to receive old clothes, and to
issue new or reclaimed serviceable garments.</p>

<p>The ordnance property salvaged in the field in the period between
January 1, to October 31, 1918, included 5,000,000 rounds of small-arms
ammunition, 71,909 shell of the 75-millimeter size, and 16,195
of the 155-millimeter size, more than 32,000 rifles, and 21,000
machine guns and automatic rifles. The unexploded or "dud"
shell is a menace to life, and the duty of destroying these in immense
quantities fell to the salvage service.</p>

<p>Some of the salvage squads in the field were composed of men who
through lack of education or lack of knowledge of the English language
were unable to do front-line service. They were largely composed
of American troops of alien birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span></p>

<p>The divisional salvage squads sorted the materials at the railhead
dumps for shipment to the various depots. When trucks brought
up supplies to the front and unloaded, the salvage detachments there
filled them up again with all sorts of materials which had been picked
up, and the trucks carried their loads back to the railheads, the railroad
stations of the division. This queer conglomeration of trash
consisted of everything from a hairbrush to a 77-millimeter enemy
gun. To show the sorts of articles that are picked up in an area
over which an army has fought, there is given here the following list
of items selected at random from the check of a salvage shipment
from the railhead of the Twenty-sixth Division on August 12, 1918:</p>


<ul><li>1,100 pairs of leggins.</li>
<li>21 pairs of shoes.</li>
<li>30 leather gun cases.</li>
<li>21 bags of harness.</li>
<li>350 mess kits.</li>
<li>750 condiment cans.</li>
<li>750 bacon cans.</li>
<li>150 first-aid packets.</li>
<li>50 feed bags.</li>
<li>300 pistol holsters.</li>
<li>1 wagon bed.</li>
<li>275 German rifles.</li>
<li>3 boxes tent poles.</li>
<li>7 boxes gun repairs.</li>
<li>150 rifle grenade throwers.</li>
<li>4 German machine guns.</li>

<li>6,000 gas masks.</li>
<li>50 saddlebags.</li>
<li>1,400 canteens.</li>
<li>200 caps.</li>
<li>900 helmets.</li>
<li>1,025 pack carriers.</li>
<li>750 canteen covers.</li>
<li>1 wagon.</li>
<li>76 wagon parts.</li>
<li>1 ammunition cart.</li>

<li>4 boxes artillery material (telephones, etc.).</li>
<li>1,400 American canteens.</li>
<li>400 American rifles.</li>
<li>47 German automatic guns.</li>
<li>75 gun bolts.</li>
<li>100 respirators.</li>
</ul>

<p>The kitchen economics branch of the salvage branch of the American
Expeditionary Forces in the recovery of fats and glycerine and
other kitchen by-products during the month of September, 1918,
saved $57,404.19 to the Government. The value was increased in
October to $109,013.84, and in November to $120,158.63. In addition
to this saving, kitchen salvage in October produced over 25,000
pounds of grease and over 14,000 pounds of dubbin for waterproofing
shoes. This branch of the service also had the disposition of unserviceable
food supplies, entailing the salvage of large quantities of
flour, sugar, rice, and beans damaged in transportation or injured by
exposure to weather so as to become unfitted for troops. Such
vegetables as peas and canned corn, unsatisfactory for use, were
dried and ground and sold for chicken feed or hog feed, bringing in
a considerable revenue.</p>

<p>The question of laundering for the field hospitals, particularly
after hard fighting, was a vital one. During the month of December,
1918, a total of 7,811,566 pieces of laundry was handled by the
laundry branch of the salvage service. This included 3,700,000
pieces for the hospitals alone. The American Expeditionary Forces
were required to establish three large shops for mending clothing
sent to the laundries.</p>

<p>The salvage service in France rendered a peculiar service in being
the repository for lost articles. The baggage branch of the salvage
service worked in close cooperation with the Army transportation
service, railroad transportation service, the central records office,
the graves registration service, the effects depot, the French railroad
officials, and other agencies which might assist them to recover
and handle all lost baggage for the members of the American Expeditionary
Forces or for their heirs in the United States.</p>

<p>The garden service of the American Expeditionary Forces was operated
as a separate branch of the Quartermaster Corps, but a word
about its work may not be amiss here. In addition to gardens at
the camps and hospitals in France, there was a large central farm at
Versailles, near Paris, where American officers and men were assembled
to learn intensive farming before being sent to the various stations
to assume charge of garden work. This service was composed
entirely of men who had been wounded or gassed, or were otherwise
physically unfit for service at the front. The garden operations provided
welcome additions of fresh vegetables to the American Expeditionary
Forces' diet and also gave many Americans an insight of
the French methods of intensive farming.</p>

<p>The 85,000 German helmets used in advertising the American Government's
fifth war loan&mdash;the Victory loan of April, 1919&mdash;were all
collected and shipped to the United States by the salvage service of
the American Expeditionary Forces. In fact the immense quantities
of dunnage and junk collected by the service are expected to be of
untold historic value as time goes on. Various historical societies
and museums are taking steps to secure collections of this war material.</p>

<p>Civilians in Europe are now wearing shoes built originally for
American troops, later worn out by them, and still later reconditioned
by the salvage service in France. A large number of these shoes
recently sold for approximately $4.30 a pair. Since the average total
cost to repair shoes was $1.05 a pair, the Government realized a net
gain of $3.25 from every pair of these shoes.</p>

<p>In connection with the conservation of waste materials the salvage
service conducted a considerable manufacturing enterprise in France.
It turned waste into a large number of small articles, such as metal
markers for graves or effects of deceased soldiers, sheet tin (this from
discarded tin containers) for lining the stables at the remount depots,
large shipping bags, cement sacks, collar ornaments, divisional insignia,
brassards, overseas caps, guidons, curtains for engine cabs,
and many other things. The service took discarded campaign hats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
and old uniform and overcoat cloth and made hospital slippers with
cloth tops and felt soles.</p>

<p>Such things as waste cotton scrap, waste paper, shredded rope,
tin cans, and woolen rags collected in France were saved and sold, but
nothing was sold that could be utilized for repairing or manufacturing
purposes. Leather scrap was used to make leather straps or
shoe laces, and the worst of the leather scrap was burned at the power
plants of the salvage depots as a fair substitute for coal. Old harness,
books, small scraps, leather washers, and the like, canvas and burlap
scrap, went to the camouflage screen makers. Woolen rags were
shredded and used over again for making cloth. Cotton rags too
poor for other purposes went to the paper mills. Rubber scrap became
new rubber material. Nothing which had a value was allowed
to go to waste.</p>

<p>The salvage depot at Tours, France, alone in the period from March
to November, 1918, inclusive, produced goods to the value of $19,383,353.58,
at a total expense of $268,955.37, giving the Government
a net profit of $19,114,398.21.</p>

<p>The value of all this work went far beyond the value of the figures
in dollars and cents, which is the only concrete way in which it can be
expressed. The saving in raw material alone which it effected was
an important factor in the war; yet of even greater service was the
salvage production of materials, particularly ordnance materials,
which took much time to manufacture at home and after that required
a long haul to get them to the American Expeditionary Forces.
Some of the materials recovered on the battle field were scarce and
hard to get, and every pound of them recovered added that much
to the power of the American Army in France.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

CANTONMENTS AND CAMPS.</h3>


<p>As soon as America had arranged to raise an army by selective
conscription, the Government proceeded to provide living quarters
for the soldiers to be mobilized for training.</p>

<p>This was a job magnificent in its proportions, carried out with a
speed that was little short of magical. At 16 points, widely scattered
over the country, the construction expert and the civil engineer struck
the earth with their potent wands; workmen swarmed forth; the staccato
of myriads of hammers and the whine of saws merged into a
rolling chorus of industry; and 16 new cities arose&mdash;almost overnight,
it seemed&mdash;built of wood to be sure, raw and unpainted it is true, but
snug and taut and equipped with every necessary convenience
known to the dwellers of modern American cities.</p>

<p>The United States had been wont to measure other public works
by that of the Panama Canal, which had been the largest construction
operation ever undertaken by America, or any other nation, prior to
the great war. The construction cost of the Panama Canal was
approximately $375,000,000 and the operation continued over a
period of 10 years. The 16 cantonments for the National Army and
the 16 camps for the National Guard cost about seven-tenths as much
as the Panama Canal, but they were completed in shorter time than
it takes to build an ordinary suburban dwelling house.</p>

<p>The science of warfare had made mighty strides since America's
last great war, that of 1861 to 1865, but in no respect more than in
those matters relating to the individual soldier's comfort and bodily
welfare. The soldier of 1863 lived in a tent, or in the chance
shelter of a billet. When the weather was cold he might alternately
toast and congeal at his camp fire, and at night he rolled himself in
his blanket and reposed on a pallet of straw.</p>

<p>His grandson warrior who went to the training camp in 1917
found life comfortable in a substantial barrack, warmed with steam
heat or stoves. A good mattress on a hygienic metal bed wooed his
slumbers after a hard day of training.</p>

<p>The soldier of 1861 bathed where he could and when he could.
He of 1917 kept clean daily under the shower bath. The soldier of
1861 slaked his thirst at neighboring wells or streams; and water-borne
diseases, such as typhoid fever, reaped a harvest of lives.
His successor drank water which was tested and filtered, sterilized
when necessary, and the once fatal epidemics of armies were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
away from his cantonment. This water, moreover, came to him in
a pipe under a pressure sufficient to throw a stream from a nozzle
clear over his barrack, an efficient safeguard against the fire that
might destroy his wooden city.</p>

<p>The soldier in the Civil War washed out his own clothing on the
infrequent occasions when he possessed both water and leisure. The
National Army recruit received his khaki immaculate from a modern
laundry equipped with the latest types of labor-saving machinery.
The latter's grandfather suffered from scurvy because of the limitations
of his diet. The soldier of 1917 ate tender beef and green
vegetables kept fresh in ammonia-cooled refrigerators. The fighter
of 1861 relished the hoecake baked in the ashes; his successor partook
of white bread fresh from camp ovens.</p>

<p>The camps of 1861 were arranged in haphazard fashion; those of
1917 were laid out by expert city planners. In the spring the soldier
of 1861 waded and toiled through mud; the soldier of 1917 walked
dry-shod upon walks or drove his autotruck upon macadamized or
concrete or brick camp roads. The illumination of the camps of 1861
was the light of the stars and the bivouac fires; the 1917 barracks were
built along streets radiant with electrical incandescence. For amusement
the soldiers of 1861 had their campfire choruses and rough military
sports, but the private in the National Army had the theater, the
motion picture, a library of good reading matter, the Y. M. C. A.
and similar clubhouses, the gymnasium, the post exchange where
he could buy periodicals, candy, fruit, and other small luxuries.</p>

<p>And so the contrast might be carried along. The marvel of the
cantonments of 1917 was not that a grateful Republic gave to its
conscripted soldiers the conveniences of existence enjoyed by all
urban communities, but that it provided them in such short time.
Ninety days after the first spade struck into the ground the cantonments
were ready to receive two-thirds of their men, while one or two
of the largest of all were complete in every essential respect.</p>

<p>The houses of the National Army and the National Guard went up
at the rate of $2,000,000 a day. It is almost impossible to visualize
this speed or to comprehend the feat of nailing fifteen hundred and
some odd million board feet of lumber into place in about three
months, or that of stringing wire in that time in length sufficient to
reach from New York to San Francisco and back and westward again
to Cleveland, or that of tacking enough rain-tight roofing paper to
make a canopy for the island of Manhattan, another for Atlantic City,
with nearly a square mile of it left over.</p>

<p>The cantonment job took so many nails and spikes that it created
an actual shortage in that industry. All of the factories in the
United States that make metal pipes could not turn out enough to
supply the needs of the water, sanitary, and heating systems of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
cantonments, and so wooden pipes made from staves were used in
most of the camps for piping water.</p>

<p>In the matter of lumber alone it has been computed that the total
amount ordered and mobilized by the Washington office for the
32 camps would build a board walk 12 inches wide and 1 inch thick
to the moon and half way back again. In addition to this vast
quantity of lumber there were used in the camps and cantonments
about 100,000,000 square feet of wall board&mdash;wall board being universally
used instead of lath and plaster to line and ceil rooms&mdash;12,000,000
square feet of window glass, and 100,000,000 square feet
of roofing. The 2,000,000,000 eight-penny nails used, if placed end
to end, would girdle the earth three and one-half times. The heating
systems would make a single steam radiator 100 miles long, while the
heating boilers were equivalent to one boiler 6 feet in diameter and
3 miles long.</p>

<p>The rate of the flow of materials to the army of 200,000 workmen
on the cantonment jobs gives an inkling of the speed with which they
put lumber and nails together to make barracks. It took 12 heavy
freight trains a day, 50 loaded cars to the train, to keep wood and
metal supplies at the builders' elbows. These builders erected the
camps at the rate of 30,000 tons of material a day. America had
never seen construction progress to equal that.</p>

<p>We liken swift building to the mushroom's growth, but almost
always this figure of speech is used as hyperbole. Some of the feats
of the cantonment builders, however, equaled the growth of the
mushroom in fact. In more than one instance at spots where the
sod sparkled with dew at dawn, when the builders put away
their tools at sunset there stood structures roofed and inclosed,
needing only a few interior touches each to be ready to shelter 200
men.</p>

<p>Efficiency in war is a matter of teamwork. Every vital branch of
the military organization must do its part well if the whole effort is
not to fail. The weak link in the chain might well have been the
construction organization of the Army, for here was an emergency
job on a scale beyond anything in the experience of our greatest
builders. America in her first 18 months of war was able to send to
France across 3,000 miles of dangerous water more men than the
United Kingdom in a similar period could send to the front over the
netted and laned 40 miles of English Channel. No slight share of the
credit for this achievement must go to the cantonment builders, who
despite great difficulties had the housing ready for the new armies
when they were called forth for training.</p>

<p>As soon as the United States entered the war the Government
sent out the call for technical experts of all sorts. For a quarter of a
century the United States had been specializing in technical training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
for its young men, and now in the hour of need the ability existed to
conduct the war, which in its first year was to be largely a matter
of construction and manufacture of equipment. There was a wonderful
outpouring of these men of action, the technicians who had been
building the bridges and skyscrapers of the Nation, developing its
mines, providing its water systems, designing its machinery, organizing
and commanding its trained and untrained workers, engaging
in public and private works of every description and magnitude.</p>

<p>The Army prior to the 6th of April, 1917, consisted of a relatively
insignificant force of men. For this Army the construction of barracks
and other quarters had been in the hands of the Quartermaster
General.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the Construction and Repair Division of
the Quartermaster General's Office was relieved of his former duties
and placed by the Secretary of War in charge of a new and almost
entirely independent division, reporting directly to the Secretary,
called the Cantonment Division, and charged with providing the
necessary construction and camp facilities for the National Army
and the National Guard. This was in May, 1917, at which time the
commissioned personnel of the division consisted of only three
officers. This step was recommended by the General Staff, acting
in accordance with the advice of civilian construction experts on the
Council of National Defense.</p>

<p>One year later the personnel of this division had grown to 263
officers and 1,100 civilians in Washington, the best constructors,
engineers, draftsmen, managers, purchasing agents, and other specialists
obtainable by the Government; there were hundreds of other
officers and civilian experts in the field for this organization; it had
an enlisted personnel of some 16,000 men and employed over 200,000
laborers and craftsmen; it had jobs on hand, complete and incomplete,
aggregating $600,000,000, or nearly twice the cost of the canal at
Panama, while future works then being planned and later actually
undertaken came to another $600,000,000; it had now become the
Construction Division of the Army, attached directly to the office of
the Secretary of War, charged with all the army construction within
the United States. Such was the expansion of one branch of the
Army to meet the emergency. Construction operations for the Army
overseas, conducted principally with troop labor, was in charge of the
Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p>Congress passed the selective service bill on May 18, 1917. Before
the end of May the military authorities had decided to call the first
levies of the National Army on September 1. The little Cantonment
Division, which had in the week after its birth grown to a personnel of
30 officers and numerous civilian experts, received orders to have the
camps&mdash;16 complete cities to accommodate 40,000 inhabitants each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
and 16 tent camps, with many incidental buildings and public utilities&mdash;ready
in 90 days.</p>

<p>Actually the time allowed for construction was much shorter than
that, for the last site was not approved until July 6. About 60 days
later, on September 4, the National Army cantonments were ready for
430,000 men, two-thirds of the first draft. Although some construction,
subsequently authorized, was not entirely complete until later,
the cantonments nevertheless were at all times prepared to receive
the conscripted soldiers faster than the Army could assimilate them.</p>

<p>However irksome to the impatient construction officers the interval
between the time when the cantonments were ordered and the day
when the last sites were approved, it was not time wasted by any
means. There was much preliminary work to be done. The magnitude
of the task ahead was appalling. Yet the Cantonment Division,
with scarcely anything to start with, with not even the ground selected
for a single camp site, must design and adopt types for buildings,
mobilize materials, standardize everything possible, adopt an emergency
contract that should protect the Government from the grafter
and the profiteer, locate stores of materials, commandeering them if
necessary, and also discover manufacturing plants capable of turning
out supplies as rapidly as they were needed, build up an organization
to handle the work in every detail, and be ready to start hammering
in the nails on the day the materials arrived on the jobs. Actually
these officers had something less than 20 days in which to accomplish
this feat.</p>

<p>There had been, however, a measure of pioneering in several of these
directions. The Council of National Defense had an organization of
civilian experts in many lines gathered together in Washington to
give advice to the military authorities. Through its committees the
council prepared a form of contract upon what came to be known as
the "cost-plus with sliding scale and fixed maximum fee" plan, which
limited the cantonment contractor in each case to a maximum fee of
not more than $250,000, the Army itself retaining control of the cost
of materials and the wages paid to labor.</p>

<p>Since the cantonments cost anywhere from $8,000,000 to more than
$12,000,000 each, the average fee to the contractor was slightly less
than 2&frac12; per cent, out of which the contractor had to pay overhead
expenses, such as his main office expenses and the like; so it will be
seen that the United States drove a close bargain with its cantonment
builders in spite of the breathless haste to get the work done.</p>

<p>It was not until the 1st of June that the war authorities decided
upon wood construction for the 16 National Army cantonments and
canvas tentage for the 16 camps of the National Guard. According
to the original plan, so far as could be foreseen, the cantonments were
to be permanent camps to receive fresh contingents of selectives as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
long as the war should last, whereas after receiving its training the
National Guard would go to France and leave its American camps
deserted. The wood construction was much more expensive than tentage&mdash;amounting
to $215 per man of the first draft, as it proved&mdash;but
it was permanent; once installed it made no further demands for
materials, and in convenience and comfort, especially in winter, it
was far superior to tentage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cantonment Division had designed a model barrack
building, 43 feet wide and 140 long, to house 150 men, or one
company, as the company was in the spring of 1917. Here, in the
adoption of this model and general camp plans, there might easily
have occurred in Washington a fatal indecision. Both the British
and the French armies had found by experience that a company
of 250 men was a more convenient size for trench warfare than a
smaller one. There was some question whether the American
Army would be guided by this experience. Gen. Pershing was to
decide this matter, but he did not reach Europe until June 15. A
weak executive control in Washington might have justified itself
in waiting for this decision before starting in at full speed to build
the cantonments. Those in charge of the program took upon
themselves the responsibility of building the 150-man barrack,
trusting to their own ability to adjust the buildings later to changed
conditions. As a matter of fact, when the company unit was
enlarged to 250 men, it was readily possible to house two companies
in three barracks, leaving space in two of them for the kitchen and
mess room. Still later the Construction Division built smaller
barracks for 66 men each, providing four such barracks to the
company.</p>

<p>Before a single site was selected the experts in Washington had
designed the buildings and mapped out the future cities. America,
leaving behind her the decorative atrocities of the old Victorian
days, had been seeking beauty; and this yearning had produced
a new profession, that of town planning. Town planners in the
Construction Division grouped the 1,500 buildings required by each
cantonment into two typical arrangements, known as the straight-line
and the U-shape layouts. Later at each cantonment there
was a town planner who adapted one or the other of these plans to
his local camp topography.</p>

<p>The selection of camp sites was in the hands of boards of officers
designated by the commanding officers of the six Army departments.
Early in May these boards set forth on their quest. Then ensued
a lively bidding on the part of American cities to secure cantonments
for their own neighborhoods. The Government took the utmost
advantage of such inducements as were offered. The city of
Tacoma, Wash., sold its municipal bonds to the amount of $2,000,000
and with the proceeds bought 61,000 acres at American Lake and
presented the land to the Army. This tract became the site of
Camp Lewis, most beautiful of all the cantonments.</p>

<p>This photograph, taken from kites at an elevation of 1,000 feet, shows a typical cantonment, of which sixteen were built to train the National Army in 1917.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p>The site for Camp Upton, at Yaphank, Long Island, 15,198 acres,
was provided for the Government at an annual rental of $1 per acre.
San Diego, Calif., gave 8,000 acres at Linda Vista to the Government
rent free for five years. This became the location of Camp
Kearney for the National Guard. Camp Fremont, another National
Guard training center, was pitched on 7,203 acres of ground donated
rent free for one year by the city of San Francisco. Louisville gave
the site of Camp Zachary Taylor for the National Army rent free for
two years. And there were numerous other similar inducements.</p>

<p>In all the National Army cantonments occupied 167,741 acres
which the Government obtained at an average annual rental of
$3.93 per acre after the second year of occupancy. The National
Guard camps covered 78,639 acres, at a rental of $112,042 the second
year of occupancy and thereafter.</p>

<p>The clearing of the sites was no mean part of the cantonment job.
The site of Camp Upton at Yaphank, Long Island, proved to be covered
with underbrush, and when this was cleared off it was discovered
that the remains of an old forest were still there, and stumps were
thickly scattered over the entire site. These had to be blasted or
pulled out before any building operations could proceed. The
sites in character ranged from the sandy loam of Camp Devens, in
Massachusetts, to the red clay of Virginia and South Carolina; from
the farm lands of Michigan to the prairie on which was built Camp
Travis, Tex. Some were flat; some rolling; all were different in
shape and extent; and the layout of the camp and the arrangement
of the buildings in each case had to be adapted to the local conditions
by the constructing quartermaster on the job.</p>

<p>To give a picture of a typical cantonment, let us take Camp
Grant, at Rockford, Ill., as an illustration. It cost approximately
$11,000,000; it could accommodate 45,000 men and 12,000 horses;
its buildings numbered 1,600. Water was supplied from six wells
drilled 175 feet deep. There were 38 miles of water main, while
the reservoir tanks could hold 550,000 gallons. Its electric lighting
system entailed the use of 1,450 miles of copper wire, 1,200 poles,
and 35,000 incandescent lamps.</p>

<p>During the construction period 50 carloads of building material
were unloaded at Camp Grant every day, and an average of 500,000
board feet of lumber was put up every day over a period of weeks.
In the Camp Grant schedule we find such items as 50,000,000 feet
of lumber, 700 tons of nails, 4,000,000 square feet of roofing, and
3,000,000 square feet of wall board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>Only a builder of secure financial standing could handle such a
construction contract. Frequently his pay roll and current bills
for supplies amounted to half a million dollars in a week. Let the
Government delay a few days in its payments to him and he might
find himself obliged to raise a million dollars in cash on the instant
to meet his immediate obligations.</p>

<p>To avoid such embarrassments the Construction Division adopted
the policy of paying its bills the day and sometimes the hour they
were incurred. At each cantonment job it stationed a disbursing
officer with a checkbook. This officer reported by telegraph each
night, and the next morning there was deposited to his credit in the
Treasury a sum of money sufficient for his immediate needs. On
numerous occasions this officer paid for materials the instant they
were unloaded from the cars and checked. The Government maintained
an auditing organization at each job. This organization
checked and inspected all material as it was received, comparing
the delivery in each case with the original order, and counted the
workmen at least twice a day.</p>

<p>An intense rivalry sprang up in the construction of the 16 cantonments.
Sixteen teams, with an average of 10,000 men on each
team, began racing for the goal, which was to be 80 per cent completion
by September 5, the date when the first contingents of
selective soldiers were to be received by the cantonments. It was
more exciting than any campaign in any professional baseball
league, because the time was shorter and the stake vastly greater.
The Cantonment Division kept alive this spirit of rivalry by posting
each day in each cantonment the figures showing the rates of
construction at all of them. The team, from the superintendents
down to the humblest unskilled laborers, discussed these ratings
as fans talk about the baseball averages.</p>

<p>The race was a close one, being won by Camp Taylor at Louisville,
which was 79.4 per cent complete on the day the contest ended,
lacking only six-tenths of 1 per cent of coming up to the maximum
80 per cent of completion regarded as possible in the time available.
But other construction gangs were pressing that at Camp Taylor
closely: Camp Travis, with 78.6 per cent of completion at the end
of the contest; Camp Lee, 78.5 complete; Camp Devens, 74; Camp
Lewis, 72; and Camp Sherman, 70. The Camp Lewis percentage
was taken on August 31.</p>

<p>All construction work, including numerous additions not contemplated
in the original plans, was virtually complete by November
30. These additional structures included cantonment base hospitals,
on which the Government spent $10,000,000 for the National Army
and $7,500,000 at the National Guard camps. With one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
exceptions these hospitals each had facilities for 1,000 patients at
once, being the largest in the United States, at that time.</p>

<p>At several of the cantonments the water problem was simplified
by the near presence of water mains of the systems of adjacent cities.
At the other camps, however, it was necessary to construct independent
water systems sufficient to furnish 55 gallons of water daily
to each of 45,000 men. This is nearly twice as much water as was
then being furnished to the average European army camp, and it
meant in each case a system of centrifugal pumps and gravity tanks
with a capacity of 2,250,000 gallons daily.</p>

<p>The local water supply was secured either from running streams
or from dug wells. If the purity of the water was in doubt it was
sterilized by the chlorine process and sometimes filtered in addition.
The purity of the water and the care exercised in screening kitchens,
mess halls, and later the dormitories themselves, from flies is seen in
the hospital record for the first year of the war. Of all the soldiers
who sought hospital treatment for sickness during that first year, only
one patient in 5,000 was suffering from a water-borne disease.</p>

<p>In each cantonment there were about 1,500 wooden buildings,
presenting a constant fire menace. As a protection from such
disasters each cantonment organized its own fire department with
modern motor equipment stationed in three or more fire houses.
The men of the fire companies were usually those who had had
previous training as members of city fire departments. There was
not a single serious fire at the cantonments during the war period.</p>

<p>Besides keeping soldiers well and clean, the camp facilities
provided them with opportunity for moral and healthy amusement.
Various organizations combined to supply the camps with amusement
facilities. There were the library buildings, the Red Cross buildings
and halls, the Y. M. C. A. buildings, the Knights of Columbus buildings,
the Salvation Army buildings, Y. W. C. A. buildings, and the Jewish
Welfare Board buildings.</p>

<p>Although the American soldier bought liberally of Liberty bonds,
took out War Risk insurance, and sent to his family the greater
portion of his monthly pay, still he had a small amount of money
to spend for little luxuries or necessities. These included small
supplies such as candy and fruits, and they were on sale at the usual
post exchange or company store. This was a small building,
usually with a broad covered porch or shelter around three sides,
so that the men in bad weather could be dry as they waited in line
for their turn at the windows. The Y. M. C. A., K. of C., Red Cross,
Y. W. C. A., Jewish Welfare Board, and Salvation Army buildings
offered reading and writing rooms and general gathering places; yet
these were insufficient for a total camp population averaging 40,000.
Hence the Commission on Training Camp Activities built through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
the agency of the Construction Division a Liberty Theater at each
camp.</p>

<p>The Liberty Theaters were of temporary construction, but in size
compared favorably with the largest theaters in our modern cities.
To provide these amusement facilities the Construction Division
put up approximately 5,000,000 board feet of lumber, 9,000,000
square feet of wall board, and 40,000 square feet of roofing.</p>

<p>The average large city laundry was insufficient in capacity to
handle the laundry work of an average of 6,000 people per day,
which was the requirement to keep some 40,000 men in clean clothing.
Consequently the camps and cantonments were provided with their
own laundries built by the Construction Division. This put such a
demand upon the manufacturers of laundry machinery that it created
a shortage, and later there was a shortage of soap and powder. The
30 laundries built used up 13,000,000 board feet of lumber and
300,000 square feet of wall board.</p>

<p>The householder may throw his old shoes into the trash box and
sell his old suit to the ragman, but the Army threw nothing away.
Consequently the Construction Division was called upon to build
reclamation plants at many stations. Usually one large plant was
built at a center convenient to several camps, and to this center were
sent the worn-out uniforms, shoes, leggins, and all other equipment.</p>

<p>Every camp of considerable size in the United States was provided
with model bakeries. The total capacity of all the baking equipment
installed by the Construction Division would turn out 1,000 tons of
bread per day. This is a total of 2,000,000 loaves of 1 pound each.
Each camp bakery oven would take care of 4,500 men per day
in two 8-hour shifts, or it could bake 5,000 loaves in 24 hours.</p>

<p>There were required at all the camps and cantonments numerous
storehouses for materials to be used immediately by the troops.
The Construction Division built 789 of these small storehouses at the
National Army cantonments alone.</p>

<p>The question of cold-storage facilities for the camps offered a knotty
problem. Certain camps generally relied upon cold-storage space
obtained near by, or else upon refrigerator cars iced in the vicinity,
but in the other camps it was necessary to build special refrigeration
plants. These had an ice-making capacity ranging from 6 to 35
tons daily. The ice consumption of the American soldiers in the
United States proved to be 2&frac34; pounds per man per day.</p>

<p>The kitchens in the camps and hospitals would be paradise to
any woman who had drudged with old-fashioned methods and equipment
in cooking. As far as possible the Army's housekeeping was
done by machinery. The bread slicer in common use would cut 200
slices of bread per minute and stack the slices automatically, the
loaves feeding automatically into the slicer. The meat choppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
would cut up 20 pounds of meat or vegetables in five minutes, and
the electrically operated potato peeler would peel 40 pounds of
potatoes in three minutes. The meat slicers would cut meat at the
rate of 40 slices to the minute. Vegetables were cooked and meats
roasted by high-pressure steam. The vegetable cooker could turn
out 35 gallons of cooked product in 15 minutes. The dish-washing
machines could wash, dry, and sterilize 10,000 dishes per hour. At
the hospitals the food was taken from the central kitchen to the
outlying wards in mobile fireless cookers, designed to keep the food
hot until served.</p>

<p>To prepare food for 45,000 men, 350 kitchens were required by each
cantonment. The National Army in training used 9,000 hotel ranges.</p>

<p>In most of the cantonments, particularly those in the South, the
heating of quarters in winter was accomplished by means of room
heaters and cannon stoves. The constructors installed 75,000 of
these. The officers' quarters everywhere and four entire cantonments
in the North&mdash;Devens in Massachusetts, Grant in Illinois, Custer in
Michigan, and Dodge in Iowa&mdash;were heated by steam either from
central heating plants or by means of ordinary boilers such as are
used in residences. The total surface of the steam radiators installed
would make five gigantic stoves 300 feet square and as high as the
Woolworth Building in New York.</p>

<p>Besides the camps and cantonments used by the line troops, the
Construction Division also built various special camps required by
the mobilization, training, and transportation of the Army. These
included the quartermaster training camp at Jacksonville, Fla.,
accommodating approximately 35,000 men; and the camps for the
Engineering Corps, camps for heavy and light artillery training
schools, and for other special units.</p>

<p>Camp Joseph F. Johnston at Blackpoint, the quartermaster camp
near Jacksonville, is a good example of one of these special training
camps. This consisted of quarters for 150 officers, 32 barracks to
house 200 men each, together with barracks for wagon companies,
pack companies, truck companies, and a bakery company, as well as
stables for 1,200 animals and 50 riding horses, together with storeroom
buildings and truck and auto garages.</p>

<p>Camp Holabird, near Baltimore, used for teaching men to repair
and crate motor trucks and vehicles, had accommodations for about
7,500 men. Another special camp was Camp Humphreys, for the
training of men in the Corps of Engineers, located a few miles down
the Potomac River from Washington. This camp could accommodate
33,000 men in 1,350 buildings located on a camp area of 2,500 acres.
Every foot of this site had to be cleared of timber and underbrush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
during one of the severest winters of recent years. All material had
to be hauled in trucks over fearful roads pending the construction
of a 5-mile spur of railroad track, yet the job was completed approximately
on time.</p>

<p>Other special camps included Camp Bragg for training Field
Artillery, located at Fayetteville, N. C., with quarters for 11,000
men; Camp Knox at Stithon, Ky., for 30,000 men, having an area
of nearly 60,000 acres for training troops in the use of Field Artillery;
and Camp Franklin, located on part of the Camp Meade cantonment
reservation, a special camp for Signal Corps instruction, with accommodations
for 11,000 men.</p>

<p>Then there was the Coast Artillery training cantonment, Camp
Eustis at Lee Hall, Va., which had accommodations for 17,000 men;
Camp Meigs at Washington, D. C., a quartermaster camp, providing
accommodations for 4,000 men; and Camp Benning, at Columbus, Ga.,
an infantry school of arms, to accommodate 5,040 men, on a camp
area of 98,000 acres. At Camp Raritan, at Raritan River, N. J.,
the Ordnance Department established a training school for 6,250
men.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

MISCELLANEOUS CONSTRUCTION.</h3>


<p>Great as was the job of building the army camps and cantonments,
it was nevertheless only a part of the work which fell to the Construction
Division, and much the smaller part at that.</p>

<p>On November 11, 1918, the Construction Division was conducting
535 building operations in 442 localities in the United States. These
involved an aggregate expenditure of more than $1,000,000,000.
Including the various camps and cantonments, these activities were
being conducted or had been conducted in every State of the Union
but one. An average of more than 200,000 workmen, principally of
the building trades, had been engaged continuously for months.</p>

<p>In the executive administration of the work the organization
required 1,487 officers and 12,355 civilian Government employees,
of whom 2,555 were located at the offices of the division in Washington.
Merely for the maintenance and the operation of the various
completed projects a force of 16,359 enlisted men was required. In
a little more than a year the organization had grown from a handful
of clerks and executives to one of this size. The brigadier general
who headed the Construction Division had been a Captain when war
was declared.</p>

<p>In this period the organization had housed a population equal to
that of the city of Philadelphia in 40 large camps, each in number
of inhabitants comparing in size to such cities as Racine, Wis.,
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, or Wheeling, W. Va. It had constructed
storage depots and warehouses that would cover 890 acres. It had
built hospitals with beds for 128,378 patients. It had purchased
and nailed up 2,647,605,426 board feet of lumber, enough to stretch
around the Equator twenty times in boards 12 inches wide and 1
inch thick. Loaded on freight cars to their capacity this lumber
would require a train reaching from Washington, D. C., to Kansas
City. It had used enough brick to build an 18-foot road from Kansas
City to Chicago. It had constructed 645 miles of railroads and
made 1,081 miles of wagon roads, mostly of concrete. These are
only a few of the high points in this building record.</p>

<p>There are few undertakings of mankind in all history which can
be compared with this enterprise. The price paid for the Panama
Canal and the Canal of Suez, the cost of damming the Nile and tunneling
the Alps, and the money spent on building the Government
railway into the heart of Alaska might be lumped together and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
the aggregate would not equal the cost of providing the buildings,
exclusive of those of the training camps, which the American Army
had to have in the United States after it went to war.</p>

<p>We can gain a picture of the size of this construction by considering
the building records of the United States. In this country there
are about 150 cities large enough and ambitious enough to keep
annual building statistics as the indices of their prosperity. In
these cities, whose populations range in size from that of New York
down to those of communities of 20,000 or 25,000 inhabitants, dwell
nearly a quarter of all the Americans. They are metropolitans, the
people who demand most of the builder for their comfort and luxury.
Yet in no one year had the building construction in these 150 largest
American cities combined approached in amount within $250,000,000
of the cost of our military construction undertaken during the war.</p>

<p>The Government became not only the greatest of customers for
the building industry but almost the sole customer. This whole
great industry, one of the largest in the country, which had been
busy in its interminable task of providing the mansions of peace,
was suddenly converted under military direction into a machine for
building a titantic war plant. Before the Nation could mobilize its
material resources or train its human ones for war it must have
buildings&mdash;headquarters for its executives, barracks for its men,
structures for its various arsenals for the manufacture of explosives
and chemicals, warehouses for the storage of reserves of material,
terminals for the transfer of overseas shipments, schools, laboratories,
proving grounds for testing its weapons, hospitals, embarkation
depots, and a vast number of structures for less conspicuous activities.</p>

<p>It was the work of the Construction Division to provide these
facilities. Exclusive of the cantonments themselves, this work fell
into projects ranging in size from small building groups costing a few
thousand dollars to enormous powder plants, huge terminal docks,
vast warehouses and other great undertakings costing $10,000,000,
$16,000,000, $25,000,000, $40,000,000, and as high as $70,000,000
for a single project.</p>


<h4>ORDNANCE CONSTRUCTION.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most striking of these undertakings were the various
construction jobs called for by the ordnance program. There were
more than 60 of these, and they ranged in cost from $100,000 up to
$70,000,000.</p>

<p>One of the larger of these projects was that of the Aberdeen proving
grounds on Chesapeake Bay, not far distant from Baltimore. This
reservation, with its area of 35,000 acres and its magnificent testing
and observation ranges, 75 miles in length, over the waters of the
bay, will undoubtedly be retained permanently by the Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
As the plant exists to-day it has a capacity of testing 5,000 shell
between daylight and dark.</p>

<p>At Aberdeen the Construction Division built barracks to house
8,000 men, quarters for 230 officers, and all the accessories of convenience
and amusement which a community of that size should have.</p>

<p>Guns came to the proving grounds unassembled, so that it was
necessary to build an assembly plant. This building is 165 feet
wide and 500 feet long and cost $1,000,000. As an adjunct to the
assembly plant there is a machine shop which is one of the largest
in the United States.</p>

<p>Mention should be made of the 25 miles of standard railway trackage
which the Construction Division put down at Aberdeen. This was
exclusive of the spur tracks for the heavy guns mounted on railway
carriages. These tracks approached the firing range on apparently
outlandish curves and at every variety of angle. The guns were
fired at these various angles to determine if the recoil would push the
carriages from the track or would spread the rails.</p>

<p>The development of aerial bombing and the necessity for testing
our own aerial bombs required the construction at Aberdeen of
hangars and quarters for an aviation squadron.</p>

<p>In addition to these facilities, the project involved the construction
of powder magazines, shell-loading plants, and warehouses. There
were built 15 miles of concrete roads and 30 miles of roads of other
types. Garage accommodations were provided for 100 trucks and
automobiles. The firing ranges required observation towers of
various sorts. The observation dugouts had to be of special strength,
because certain of the tests at Aberdeen involved the actual bursting
of gun barrels, making necessary specially heavy protection for the
observers.</p>

<p>Aberdeen is equipped with a complete waterworks system and
with a hospital for 250 patients. An interesting laboratory constructed
on the grounds is that in which the so-called "dud" shell,
or those which fail to explode, are analyzed for their defects. The
Aberdeen project was started in December, 1917, and first tests were
made within a month. The entire project cost over $30,000,000.</p>

<p>One section of the Aberdeen reservation, about 4,000 acres of
it, was set apart for the uses of the gas-warfare organization of the
Army and was later known as the Edgewood Arsenal. The progress
at Edgewood is indicative of the manner in which chemical warfare
increased in importance during our period of belligerency. It was
originally estimated that $250,000 would provide a plant at Edgewood
sufficient for our chemical-warfare needs. The actual cost of the
Edgewood Arsenal at the date of the armistice, so great had been
the expansion of chemical warfare, was about $43,000,000. At that
time there had been constructed or were in process of construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
filling plants that could turn out 120,000 loaded gas shell per day.
The equipment at Edgewood includes a cantonment for 10,000 men,
some of it of permanent construction. There were built 10 miles of
macadam road at Edgewood and 15 miles of railway, in addition to
large warehouses and a dock where loaded shell could be freighted
upon lighters to deep water.</p>

<p>Another project made necessary by the expansion of chemical
warfare was the gas proving grounds at Lakehurst, N. J., the entire
project costing $1,500,000. The site of 5,000 acres provided space
for two target ranges, each 4 miles long. Extensive laboratories
were built at Lakehurst, and the proving ground was operated by a
force of 1,500 men. In addition to this there was located at Lakehurst
a camp for 3,400 troops in training. All buildings for these facilities
were provided by the Construction Division.</p>

<p>In addition to Aberdeen and Lakehurst the Construction Division
built a proving ground at Clear Springs, Md., used for testing out
37-millimeter guns; another such institution at Port Clinton, Ohio,
for testing 155-millimeter and 240-millimeter howitzers; and others at
Scituate, Mass., and Savanna, Ill. The combined cost of these last
four projects was $6,507,520.</p>

<p>One important undertaking of the Construction Division was that
of providing warehouse depots for ordnance materials. These supplies
differ from ordinary Army supplies in the important particular
that they must be treated gently and handled with care. A quartermaster
storehouse can be of emergency construction type, that is,
more or less built of wood, but an ordnance storehouse, since it
usually contains high explosives, must be strictly fireproof. In
undertaking the creation in record time of a number of ordnance
depots the Construction Division faced not only the problem of the
type of building required but also the location of these buildings.
It was necessary to locate them at deep water in order to avoid frequent
handling of the high explosives, yet no depot could be situated
in any thickly settled center because of the danger to the civilian
population. At most deep-water points on the Atlantic coast
which had railway connections the available sites were already occupied.
The result was that the ordnance depots had to be built on
marshes and meadows, on land which for construction purposes had
always been regarded as impossible. Yet they had to be completed
in as much of a rush as any buildings which the Army demanded.</p>

<p>There are now five of these great ordnance depots on the Atlantic
coast built by the Construction Division: at Metuchen, N. J.;
Curtis Bay, Md.; Pig Point, Va.; Charleston, S. C.; and Pedricktown,
Del. The largest of these is the one at Metuchen, known as the
Raritan Arsenal. The Raritan site contains about 2,200 acres of
salt marsh. High tides used to submerge the whole area almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
completely. Before any building could be started the Construction
Division had to build a dike 9 miles long around the whole reservation.
The entire project was perched on piles, and these piles, by
the tens of thousands, were driven into the frozen ground during
the severe winter of 1917-18. Labor was hard to get and hard to
keep. After the laborers' quarters had been built and a few powder
magazines had been erected, it became almost impossible to keep
men on the job because of the danger of working in a powder arsenal.</p>

<p>Most of the Raritan buildings are of terra-cotta construction.
There are 85 completed magazines, each 51 feet wide and 218 feet
long, for the storage of shell, black powder, and miscellaneous items,
this number not including 12 magazines of sheet-metal construction,
each 26 by 42 feet, for the storage of high explosives. When
the armistice was signed the Construction Division was building 60
similar magazines intended for the storage of smokeless powder.</p>

<p>At Raritan was also located a school of instruction for ordnance
troops, with a cantonment to accommodate 10,000 men. A 150-bed
hospital was part of the equipment, as was also an assembly
shop and a motor-instruction school.</p>

<p>Along the river a dock was built 2,000 feet long. On the dock
were constructed several huge warehouses for the storage of material.
Fifty miles of railway were constructed. The project on the
armistice date was probably the best equipped ordnance depot in
the world. It cost about $14,000,000.</p>

<p>The next largest ordnance depot is that at Curtis Bay near Baltimore.
It is half the size of the Raritan project and cost about
$7,000,000.</p>

<p>The Pig Point ordnance depot is located at Hampton Roads, about
12 miles from Portsmouth, Va. In order to obtain berthing facilities
for trans-Atlantic ships it was necessary to build a dock more
than a mile long out to deep water. The dock is said to be the
longest wharf in the United States south of Philadelphia. The Pig
Point job cost about $3,500,000.</p>

<p>The Charleston Arsenal cost $5,000,000; while $7,000,000 was the
amount provided for the arsenal at Pedricktown. The Pedricktown
job, however, was started late, and not over $2,000,000 had been
spent when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>In addition to these five terminal depots the Construction Division
provided two other ordnance warehouses for the storage of
miscellaneous supplies&mdash;one at Middletown, Pa., costing $1,250,000,
and the other at Augusta, Ga., costing $250,000.</p>

<p>The description of the powder bag-loading plants, which were
built by the Construction Division, is contained in the chapter of
this report relating to the production of powder and other explosives.
There were three of these plants, one located at Woodbury, N. J.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
another at Tullytown, Pa., and the third on the historic battle ground
at Seven Pines, Va. Since these plants were perforce located at
isolated places it was necessary in each case to provide housing
accommodations for the workers, many of whom were women. The
Construction Division built the houses at Tullytown and Woodbury
while those at Seven Pines were provided by the United States
Industrial Housing Corporation.</p>

<p>These bag-loading plants cost from $4,500,000 to $6,000,000
apiece, and they were erected in a remarkably short time. Work
was started on the Woodbury project on March 19, 1918, and the
plant was ready for operation on May 28, although the plant did not
actually start operating until June 15. The spade was first struck
into the ground at Tullytown on March 6, 1918, and on July 17 the
250 buildings of the project were ready. The work at Seven Pines
began April 24, and the plant was ready for operation on August
24, 1918.</p>


<h4>AVIATION SCHOOLS AND TESTING FIELDS.</h4>

<p>The Signal Corps, needing a special type of construction, undertook
the work itself at the start of war, but by October, 1917, the
Construction Division had proved itself so efficient that all Army
building work in the United States, including that of the Signal
Corps, was turned over to it. The work for the Signal Corps entailed
the construction of the necessary buildings for flying fields, testing
fields, aerial photography, and gunnery schools, balloon observation
schools, repair and testing shops, and tremendous storage depots
that had to be of special fireproof construction because of the inflammable
nature of the oil and other materials used by the Signal Corps.</p>

<p>At the aviation fields a special type of portable hangar built of
steel, 65 by 140 feet, was adopted. For the big bombing planes
larger hangars were required but of the same-type of construction.
At each aviation field were barracks for a large number of men,
together with water and sanitary conveniences. There were 31 of
these fields located principally in the West or Southwest.</p>

<p>In addition to these there were four testing fields for the aircraft
service, located in the eastern half of the United States where the
flying machines and the engines were being produced. One of these
was at Dayton, another at Buffalo, a third at Detroit, and a fourth
at Elizabeth, N. J. The aerial gunnery school at Miami, Fla., was
one of the largest of the aviation-construction projects. This plant
included buildings, target ranges, steel hangars, photographic laboratories
and other equipment&mdash;all built at a cost of $1,500,000.</p>

<p>The balloon school at Lee Hall, Va., cost $1,000,000, and that at
Arcadia, Calif., $500,000. At each of these schools there were
barracks for the men, quarters for the laborers, and experimental
buildings, not to speak of the huge sheds, 200 or more feet in length,
in which the balloons were housed.</p>

<h4>QUARTERMASTER BASES AND WAREHOUSES.</h4>

<p>Construction for the Quartermaster Department involved the
building of warehouses on a scale hitherto unknown in the United
States. The warehouse plan was carefully worked out as part of
the strategy of conducting the war, the Council of National Defense
making the first investigations of the proper locations of supply
depots, and these early findings being later amended by the General
Staff. Several important considerations determined the locations of
these depots and warehouses. In the first place we would require
great storage and shipping facilities at tidewater; yet, if these were
all to be located in one spot or in one general region, there was a
possibility that a submarine blockade off the Atlantic coast could
stop the shipment of supplies to the American Expeditionary
Forces. Thus the first project was to locate the great supply bases
at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Norfolk. But it was
evident that a relatively small number of enemy submarines operating
in a comparatively restricted area could block shipment from
these four ports. Therefore Charleston, S. C., and New Orleans
were added to the supply-base project.</p>

<p>There was another thing to be taken into consideration, namely,
the providing of sufficient warehouse space, so that, if there should
be any blockade of ocean transportation, the manufacture of supplies
could continue at its war rate and still find places to which to ship
its important products. Yet if the storage were all provided at
the tidewater bases, there would be danger of railroad congestion
at the ports. Consequently, as auxiliary to the terminal warehouses,
there was provided a system of enormous warehouses built in the
interior of the United States.</p>

<p>The system eventually worked out to give seven expeditionary
supply bases located, six of them, at the cities just named, in addition
to one that had been built at Port Newark, N. J., during the winter
of 1917, and nine interior depots located respectively at Baltimore,
Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Jeffersonville, Ind., New Cumberland,
Pa., Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Schenectady, N. Y., and St. Louis.
These latter were central in various producing districts.</p>

<p>The terminal projects alone involved construction on a scale that
was without precedent. The interior depots and the huge
terminal bases provided 690 acres of storage space, all inclosed in
reinforced concrete of the most modern type. They were all built
in a little over 12 months. Into them went construction enough
to build a concrete building 70 feet wide from New York to Philadelphia
and a wharf nearly 8 miles long, with berthing accommodations
for 65 ships at once. The facilities included 650 miles of railroad and
1,000 miles of concrete roadway.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span></p>

<p>The Army supply bases at Brooklyn and at Boston are examples
of the immensity of the expeditionary depots built along the Atlantic
seacoast. The base at Brooklyn has approximately 4,000,000 square
feet of storage space in its two huge 8-story reinforced concrete
warehouses. One of these warehouses is 980 feet long by 200 feet
wide and the other is 980 feet long by 300 feet wide. In addition
to these, the installation at the base consists of three double-deck
piers, each 150 feet wide and 1,300 feet long, and one open pier 60
feet wide and 1,300 feet long. In its railroad yards there is storage
space for 1,300 cars at one time. The capacity of the base is 700,000
tons of supplies, or the equivalent of about 100 shiploads. Twelve
ships of 8,000 tons, dead weight each, can be loaded at one time, and
the loading of these vessels can be completed within 24 hours, so
vast and complete are the facilities at this project.</p>

<p>Construction started at the site on May 15, 1918. More than
7,000 workmen were engaged on this job at one time, and the entire
project was to be completed before July 1, 1919, while it was to be
in partial operation by January 1. When the armistice was
signed, 4,387,360 square feet of floor space had been completed
and 187,173 cubic yards of concrete had been poured.</p>

<p>The base at Boston is 8 stories high, built of concrete, and gives
2,750,000 feet of storage room. Its wharves are 4,000 feet long.
The work on it was started May 14, 1918, and ended October 3. In
that time 200,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 22,000
tons of reinforcing and structural steel put into position, 3,000,000
brick laid, 30,000 piles driven, 1,500,000 cubic yards dredged, and
30 miles of track laid. In all, 7,000 carloads of material were
handled in this building.</p>

<p>The Norfolk base is located at Bush Bluff, 4 miles from the city.
The chief feature of this project is a group of eight 1-story concrete
buildings providing 2,000,000 square feet of storage space. The pier
sheds are built of concrete blown by compressed air upon steel lath.
The docks total a mile in length. The base can handle 600 cars of
supplies in a day. In addition to the storage and shipping buildings
themselves, the Construction Division provided quarters for a regiment
of stevedores and a battalion of guards. A 120-bed hospital
was erected at the project. The wharfage front was made of concrete
piles weighing 12 tons apiece, and 217 acres of land were made
by dredging outside of the piles and filling in behind them. The
work was started in May and was nearly finished when the armistice
was signed.</p>

<p>The Norfolk and Hampton Roads district has the distinction of
being the center of more war construction than was conducted at
any other point in the United States. There were located here the
Navy arsenal, the Navy yard, the Navy training station, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
great Norfolk naval base. The largest construction project of
all at Norfolk was the quartermaster terminal which the Construction
Division built there. But in addition to these there was the
Pig Point ordnance depot, described above, Camp Stuart and Camp
Hill, both embarkation camps, the Artillery school at Fortress
Monroe, Camp Eustis, and the Langley aviation field of the Army.</p>

<p>With so many construction undertakings going on at once, the
labor problem proved to be an early embarrassment at the Norfolk
quartermaster terminal job. However, good quarters and good
food for the construction gangs at the terminal largely solved this
problem. At one time in the development on the shores of this part
of Chesapeake Bay, the street car and electric lighting system of
Norfolk broke down under the strain. The Government thereupon
took the power house and operated it thereafter for the duration of
the emergency.</p>

<p>The interior storage depots of the Quartermaster Department
provide 12,000,000 square feet of storage. They are all of permanent
construction. They range in size from the one at Pittsburgh, with
184,000 square feet, to that at Schenectady with 2,500,000 square
feet.</p>

<p>The depot at Chicago was built by the Central Manufacturing
District as contractor on a site sold by its trustees to the Government.
This structure, costing $3,000,000 and giving 29 acres of storage, was
built completely in the period between March 4 and September 15,
1918.</p>


<h4>MOTOR TRANSPORT CONSTRUCTION.</h4>

<p>There was extensive construction for the Motor Transport Corps.
Few civilians perhaps realize the size attained by this branch of the
Army, with its more than 3,000 officers and 100,000 men in the
United States and abroad. The Construction Division designed a
standardized repair shop to be used in this country or to be transported
overseas as desired. There were three centers of repair,
shipment, and the training of men for the Motor Transport Service,
the largest being Camp Holabird at Baltimore and the others, Camp
Jesup at Atlanta, and Camp Normoyle at San Antonio, Tex.</p>

<p>When the armistice was signed the Army had in this country
thousands of motor trucks, motorcycles, and ambulances. Perhaps
80 per cent of these were located in the districts subsidiary to Camp
Holabird. Consequently, there were constructed at Holabird an
enormous repair shop and a shop for the taking down and shipping of
motor vehicles. The machine shops at these camps were of permanent
construction. Large storage facilities were also furnished.</p>

<p>The experiences of the Army in Mexico taught that to be effective
motor transport must have adequate facilities for repair. The
standardized army repair shop is of glass, steel, and concrete construction.
It is operated by 55 officers and 1,400 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting buildings provided for the Motor
Transport Corps was the crating shop at Camp Holabird. The first
motor trucks sent overseas were shipped completely assembled.
In addition to taking up unnecessarily much-needed cargo space on
the transports, they frequently arrived in poor condition, due to the
effects of the salt air upon their metal parts.</p>

<p>Consequently, it was decided to ship trucks disassembled in
crates. One of these huge vehicles could be taken apart and, except
for its truck body, wrapped up in a parcel 20 feet long, 40 inches
wide and 40 inches deep. The truck body could be packed in a
crate 12 feet long and 6 feet wide and 1 foot thick. These crates were
moisture proof.</p>

<p>The crating of trucks saved 75 per cent of the ship space formerly
required. The crating crews became so facile that they could take
down and pack in a single day from a mile and a half to two miles
of trucks. This unique shop cost $500,000.</p>

<p>The construction at Camp Holabird started February 4, 1918.
The camp now occupies 144 acres and has a cantonment for 7,000
men. The 22 buildings of an abandoned distillery on the ground
were remodeled to serve as permanent storehouses for the millions of
dollars' worth of tools and motor-vehicle parts which the Government
acquired in the war.</p>


<h4>ARMY HOSPITALS.</h4>

<p>For the Surgeon General's Department the Construction Division
constructed hospitals in this country providing accommodations for a
total of 121,000 patients, 12,000 nurses, 4,000 doctors, and 34,000
hospital operation and maintenance troops. There were 294 of these
hospitals in all, built at a total cost of $127,725,000 and divided into
three types: base hospitals located at the various training camps,
departmental hospitals located at various other Army posts, and
general hospitals for the reception of sick and wounded men returning
from France. The construction of general hospitals did not cease
with the signing of the armistice, and at a recent date it had provided
97,000 beds for patients.</p>

<p>The builders adopted a standardized type of hospital construction.
The unit in this type was a single-story ward building of frame
construction lined in the interior with gypsum board or some similar
material. An open porch along the entire length of one side of the
ward building provided opportunity for convalescents to be wheeled
outdoors. Each ward had room for 34 beds and also had a diet
kitchen, a nurses' room, a doctors' room, lavatories, and an inclosed
solarium at the end. These buildings were connected with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
other by inclosed corridors running through the clear. At the
Fox Hills Hospital, Staten Island, N. Y., there was a mile and a
quarter of this corridor construction. The corridors in each case
fed in toward the central administration group of buildings in which
were located the operating rooms and the various laboratories.</p>

<p>As crews developed their teamwork some marvelous instances of
speed were shown in putting up the buildings. One crew of 566 men
at Fox Hills erected a complete hospital wing in one working day.
At 7 o'clock in the morning the ground of the site was untouched.
That night at 6 o'clock a 40-bed ward was standing finished on the
site&mdash;painted, equipped with heating and ventilating apparatus, all
plumbing installed, the last electric bulb screwed in, and in every
respect ready for occupancy. It was like magic; yet soon thereafter
the Construction Division had set the period of 10 hours as the
standard time for building one of these wings.</p>

<p>General Hospital No. 3 located at Otisville, N. Y., has a capacity
of 579 beds and is a complete military hospital plant designed for
the treatment of tubercular cases. A short summary of the work
done upon it will give an idea of the general nature of the construction
problems incident to the building of the military hospitals during
the winter and spring of 1918.</p>

<p>On February 2, 1918, the Constructing Quartermaster with a few
officers and clerks arrived at the site of the hospital, about 37 acres
of land, near the village of Otisville, Orange County, N. Y., on the
southern slope of Shawangunk Mountain. The contractor and his
organization came on the same day. They found the site covered
with snow and with no accommodations even for the office force of
the Constructing Quartermaster or the contractor, except an old
creamery building, which was promptly rented and into which the
two organizations moved the next day.</p>

<p>Actual work was started February 5 and continued through every
severity of weather until the project was completed in the early
part of July. The work was interrupted, hindered, and hampered
by snow and mud, by transportation congestion preventing the
delivery of materials on time, by the absence of local labor and the
necessity for importing labor from near-by markets wherever it could
be procured, and by the consequent necessity for running special
trains to transport laborers to and from the job. No local facilities
existed for housing any of the workmen, and temporary accommodations
had to be built to accommodate 200 Italian laborers both in
the matter of shelter and food.</p>

<p>The average height above sea level of the site of this hospital is
a little over 1,000 feet. It was found after construction began that
the site was full of springs, which caused further trouble and difficulty
in developing the building operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>

<p>The cost of the project was $1,681,000. About 300 carloads of
material were used, including approximately 3,000,000 feet of lumber.
The largest number of laborers employed at any one time was 1,795,
with a working day, as a rule, of nine hours, union and nonunion
labor being employed without discrimination. Water supply, sewer
construction, roads, 330 feet of railway siding, sewage disposal plant,
electrical installation, and boiler houses, all had to be built. The
work was all completed early in July, 1918. In addition to the bed
capacity of the hospital, accommodations were provided for a hospital
personnel of 224.</p>

<p>One of the largest hospitals involving entirely new construction is
General Hospital No. 21, Denver, Colo. This is also a hospital for
the treatment of tuberculosis cases. The construction is permanent,
hollow tile and stucco, and the hospital facilities are sufficient to
accommodate 2,000 beds for recuperative and curative work. The
plant consists of hospital wards, tuberculosis wards, officers' quarters,
nurses' quarters, mess halls, storehouses, laundry, schoolhouse,
power house, water and sewer installation, and all of the necessary
utilities for the adequate operation of a completely self-contained
unit.</p>

<p>The original authorization covered only 1,000 beds. Subsequently
there was authorized an addition equally as large, and the entire
project was completed on March 1, 1919. The actual capacity of
the hospital is in excess of the capacity estimated when the work
was begun, and it is estimated that 2,486 patients can be cared
for, the cost per bed running less than $1,350. In view of the nature
and character of the permanent construction involved, and the
fact that this is a military hospital with the usual numerous construction
details not found in civilian hospitals, the construction at
this figure is regarded as exceptional.</p>


<h4>INCIDENTS OF THE WORK.</h4>

<p>When the Government undertook the whole enormous military
construction program, it was found that there were few builders in
the United States who had equipment enough to handle the bigger
jobs. Consequently the Construction Division adopted the policy
of acquiring equipment of various sorts, usually paying rent for it.
Such equipment included locomotive cranes, concrete mixers, locomotives
for trench machines, road machinery, and other heavy
apparatus. This equipment was rented under an agreement that
whenever the rent paid had aggregated the cost of the article rented,
the latter should become the property of the Government. In this
way the Government has acquired property of this sort worth about
$3,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p>The Construction Division at all times procured raw materials for
the contractors engaged upon the projects. During the summer of
1918 the division was procuring material at an average rate of nearly
$1,000,000 per day.</p>

<p>There were many interesting incidents in connection with this
activity. In the summer of 1917, when the cantonments were
going up, it became necessary to provide some 60,000 stoves and
heaters, yet there were not that many stoves for sale in the country
including all existing stocks, nor was the capacity of the various
stove works sufficient to make up the number in the three months'
period before the soldiers would be going to the camps. Accordingly,
officers of the division were sent out to make addresses to the workmen
at the stove factories, and as a result of such efforts the companies
speeded up their output until they were able to supply
all of the camps with heating facilities by October 1, 1917. In this
effort the Government went into the market and procured the pig
iron, coke, and other supplies for the stove foundries.</p>

<p>The Construction Division was also able to obtain 15,000 Army
kitchen ranges in three months, although that number is a normal
year's output of the entire manufacturing facilities of the country.</p>

<p>When the project for the expeditionary supply base at Port
Newark was taken up&mdash;in the late fall of 1917&mdash;the Construction
Division set about it to get 63,377 piles for the foundations of this
construction. There were 64 pile drivers on the job, driving in a
total of 1,566 piles in a day; and to supply these the woodsmen of
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and New Jersey were called
upon for their best efforts. Due to the unforeseen severity of the
winter, the rivers were frozen and the railroads choked with freight.
Near by was the Hog Island shipbuilding project at Philadelphia,
needing more piles than the railroads could deliver. The trees in
the woods were frozen and often broke to pieces when they fell.
In the southern logging districts the negro woodsmen refused to
stay on the job because of the cold. The Construction Division then
took hold, sent soldiers into the woods, felled the trees, and then
put guards on the cars of piling, to see that they were not lost in
transit. As a result, the piles for the Port Newark job were delivered
on time.</p>

<p>In addition to procuring materials for its own contractors, the
Construction Division also procured building materials for the
Shipping Board and for the Bureau of Industrial Housing. The
peak load of labor on the Army construction jobs came in the summer
of 1918, when 230,000 men were on the pay roll, drawing $7,626,800
a week in pay, and still the jobs were short 150,000 unskilled men.
In general, the union scale of wages and hours of labor were adopted,
but the open shop was maintained. Labor troubles were infre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>quent
and not serious. To prevent strikes the Government formed
the Cantonment Adjustment Commission, consisting of three members,
the Army representative being Col. J. H. Alexander, of the
Construction Division. Of all the strikes that hampered our war
activities, less than 1 per cent were strikes of the building trades.</p>

<p>When the labor shortage of 1918 was most acute the Construction
Division turned to Porto Rico and the Bahamas for unskilled labor,
importing 2,600 Bahamans and 13,000 Porto Ricans. This imported
labor was exclusively used on southern building projects and was sent
back home when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>The Construction Division had charge of the operation and maintenance
of the utilities of the various training camps, a work requiring
a force of 452 officers and 16,559 men. In all there were
54,808 buildings at these camps to be kept in repair. This was done
at the cost of $8.10 a year for each man housed. The Government
supplied electricity to the camps at an average cost of $0.02&frac12; per
kilowatt hour. In a single year of operation, the 32 camps burned
about 2,000,000 tons of coal for heating. This was at a cost of
approximately $10 per man.</p>

<p>The utilities of the camps were under the management of men who
could qualify to be city managers. They had the operation of water
systems, fire departments, and other common conveniences of cities.
Water was supplied at the rate of 55 gallons daily per man. The
purity of the water and the adequacy of the sanitation may be
gauged from the fact that in July and August, 1918, the annual
death rate at the camps was 2.8 per thousand. In our Mexican War
the annual death rate of American troops from disease was 110 per
thousand; in the Civil War it was 65 per thousand; in the Spanish
War 26 per thousand; and among Japanese troops in the Russo-Japanese
War it was 25 per thousand. The death rate in civil
life for men of the draft age is 6.7 per thousand.</p>

<p>Each camp and cantonment was adequately protected by fire
companies equipped with the most modern apparatus, nearly all of
it motorized. Each camp fire company had 60 men. A low annual
fire loss in civil life is $2 per capita. In 1917, 20 American cities
of about 31,000 population each showed an annual fire loss of $2.15
per capita. The average for the United States is $2.42 per capita.
At the training camps, in spite of their inflammable construction,
the average annual loss from fire per capita was only 46 cents.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

SIGNAL CORPS MATERIAL.</h3>


<p>The spent runner who hurled himself through the gate of ancient
Athens and with his dying breath gasped out the news of the brilliant
success of the Athenian troops against the Persian at Marathon in the
year 490 B. C. was the first famous soldier of a signal corps; but
since then the exploits of the bearers of military tidings have filled
the pages of legend and story. Just as other branches of military
science have been brought to a high perfection in modern times, so
in equal degree has the art of military signaling progressed in efficiency.</p>

<p>Where the ancient athlete once exhausted his strength in bearing
military messages long distances in the field, the modern Mercury
uses the wireless phone. In Civil War days the pony express rider
brought from some desperate stand the story of the lack of ammunition;
to-day the ammunition-supply organization is in constant
touch with the front by means of telegraph or the long-distance
telephone. In the Indian campaigns in our own West messages
from beleaguered parties were sometimes conveyed by signal smokes;
the "lost battalion" in the Argonne sent news of its plight by carrier
pigeon.</p>

<p>Modern warfare has indeed retained the old, but it has also developed
the new, in transmitting military tidings. So important is this
branch of fighting that it is put in the hands of a specialized organization,
which in the American Army is known as the Signal Corps.
The Signal Corps not only had charge of the operation of the various
communicating devices in 1917 and 1918 in the field of operations
(except latterly in the air), but it also had charge of the manufacture
of the equipment for this work.</p>

<p>The production of signaling equipment was far greater than the
uninformed person would imagine. As an instance, there was one
special type of telephone wire, a form unknown to commercial use
before the war, which, before November 11, 1918, was being produced
at the rate of 20,000 miles a month, at a cost of $5,650,000 per month,
requiring the complete capacity of the day and night operation of all
fine wire machinery in the United States, except that which was
working on Navy contracts. Many other production activities of
the Signal Corps were carried through on a similar scale.</p>

<p>Until after the Civil War, the operation of large units of troops was
greatly handicapped by the limitations of military signaling as then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
known. A force could not be effective in combat that could not be
readily reached in all quarters by runners or riders or by visual signals.
The development of the telegraph and telephone and the invention
of radio changed all this, so that in the great war armies stretched
out on fronts 100 miles or more in length with every part of them in
immediate touch with every other part through the exact and complete
systems of signaling on the field.</p>

<p>Military signals to-day include the telephone, the telegraph, radio
telegraphy and telephony, the buzzer, the buzzerphone, panels,
pyrotechnics, flags, smoke signals, pigeons, dogs, mounted orderlies,
and runners. Each of these means of signaling is an adjunct to the
others; when one fails, another is employed to get the message
through. Some have special uses for branches of the service with
peculiar requirements. The radiophone is especially suited for communicating
from airplanes. Artillery fire is directed by wire and wireless
communication. Trained pigeons are sometimes able to get
messages through when all other means of communication have failed.</p>

<p>The Army did not have a great quantity of signaling equipment
when it went to war with Germany, but what it did have was good.
The American punitive expedition in Mexico, where long lines of
communication over rugged country were required, had given opportunity
for testing modern signal apparatus in the field. Many of the
signaling devices used by the American Expeditionary Forces were,
at least in type, in common use by the civilian population; yet the
procurement of this equipment offered heavy difficulties. This was
because the Army was much more exacting than was commercial
demand as to the quality of material used. For instance, a telephone
instrument for use in the field hardly can be compared with the
telephone in a business man's private office. The field set demands
stronger connections, better insulation against the dampness of outdoor
work, and more rugged construction to withstand rough usage
by an army on the march.</p>

<p>One of the larger tasks of the Signal Corps in France was that of
providing facilities for communication for the service of supply. The
first Signal Corps officers sent to France soon realized that the forthcoming
American Army could not depend upon the French telegraph
and telephone systems in the various zones of operation, because
those systems were already overburdened by the uses of the French
government. Consequently, it became necessary to set up our own
telegraph and telephone systems, extending them from the ports of
debarkation through the various bases and zones up to the battle
regions. The magnitude of the system which finally was constructed
is shown in the fact that on November 11, the date of the armistice,
there were in France 96,000 miles of American telegraph and long-distance
telephone circuits. This wire was all used by the service of
supply and by the various Army bases behind the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet in the field of fighting the requirements for wire were even
greater. At one time during the height of the operations it was
evident that the time was not far distant when the Signal Corps
would need 68,000 miles a month of what was known as outpost wire,
for use simply in connecting up the telephone and telegraph systems
carried along by the troops in their advances.</p>

<p>Outpost wire was entirely a development of the war against Germany.
The original telephone system used at the front had been
the single telephone wire grounded to complete the circuit. But all
the armies in France perfected their listening instruments to such a
degree that they could hear conversations conducted on the grounded
telephone circuits, the sounds being detected in the earth itself.
Consequently, it became necessary to carry forward with troops two-wire
telephone circuits, thus doing away with ground connections.
Even then care had to be taken that the insulation of this double
wire was perfected, lest the impulses enter the ground through gaps
in the insulation. Wireless for outpost communication was equally
impracticable, since the enemy could easily listen in and hear radio
phone messages.</p>

<p>Outpost wire insured secret communication at the front. Outpost
wire was a twist of two wires, each single wire being made up of
seven fine wires, four of them of bronze, and three of them of hard
carbon steel. These were stranded together, coated, first with
rubber and then with cotton yarn, and finally paraffined. The wire
was produced in six colors&mdash;red, yellow, green, brown, black, and
gray&mdash;for easy identification in the field, each unit employing its
own color.</p>

<p>The wastage of outpost wire was enormous. In an advancing
movement it was folly to undertake to pick up the wire. The
abandoned miles of it had to be left in the field to be salvaged later
by the clean-up parties.</p>

<p>The proposition of producing 68,000 miles of outpost wire every
month staggered the wire manufacturers of the country. There
were not enough braiding machines to complete such an order, and
new ones had to be built before such a quantity of outpost wire could
be attained.</p>

<p>In addition to the various means of communication, the Signal
Corps was also called upon to supply in large quantities such other
articles as wire reel carts, flag staffs, field glasses, photographic equipment,
chests, tools, meteorological apparatus, and wrist watches.</p>

<p>In the production of its supplies, the Signal Corps was confronted
with the same obstacles of inadequate industrial capacity, dearth of
raw materials, and congestion of railroad transportation, that embarrassed
almost every line of military production. To meet these
difficulties the Signal Corps organized an elaborate inspection force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
which not only checked the work at the various factories for quality
and rate of production, but was also constantly on hand to help the
harassed manufacturer out of his difficulties as they arose. The
Signal Corps never slept. At night and on holidays there was at
least one officer on the job in Washington to receive telegrams or
long-distance telephone messages and to be ready to act quickly in
any emergency.</p>

<p>From the production standpoint, signal equipment was divided
into several general classifications: (1) telephone and telegraph
apparatus; (2) radio apparatus; (3) line-construction materials; (4)
batteries; (5) wire and cables; (6) field glasses; (7) wire carts; (8)
photographic supplies, pigeons, and pigeon supplies; and (9) chests,
kits, and tools, mechanical signals, electric signals, meteorological
apparatus, and wrist watches.</p>


<h4>TELEPHONES AND TELEGRAPHS.</h4>

<p>In the early days of the conflict the construction of signal materials
in the United States was devoted to such basic supplies as wire,
cable, tools, and the standard types of telephone equipment, such
as telephone sets and switchboards. The first great task in France
was to install the lines of communication for the service of supply,
a system that required American equipment because it was planned
to operate it with American-trained telegraph and telephone
operators.</p>

<p>Now, there were numerous styles of commercial telephone equipment
manufactured in the United States. The plan, therefore, was
adopted of allowing the various manufacturing concerns to bid on
a tentative production schedule, giving an exclusive contract to the
lowest bidder in each type of apparatus. This exceptional policy
was adopted in order to avoid multiplicity of types of equipment to
be used abroad. If many makes were adopted in each type they
would necessitate the procurement of many types of spare parts and
replacement materials.</p>

<p>The concerns which produced the telephone equipment for the
American Expeditionary Forces were the Western Electric Co., of
Kansas City; the Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Co., of Chicago;
the Stromberg-Carlson Telephone Manufacturing Co., of Rochester;
the Frank Black Co., of Chicago; and the Reliable Electric Co., of
Chicago.</p>

<p>At the signing of the armistice there were 282 American telephone
exchanges in France, with 14,956 telephone lines reaching 8,959
stations. The 282 exchanges ranged from the small four-line monocord
unit, such as may be seen in any business office, to the standard
American multiple board of the city telephone exchange. Of these
latter there were over 30 in use by the American Expeditionary
Forces when the armistice was signed.</p>

<p>The special telephones adopted for use in the field were different
from any in commercial use in America. The Signal Corps had
developed certain special instruments combining both telephone and
telegraphic principles. The field telephone, model 1917, for instance,
was a telephone which included a telegraph buzzer on its telephone
circuit. This instrument was used when great secrecy in communication
was required. The messages were sent in telegraphic code,
the buzzers being heard by the receiver. Another instrument was
known simply as the buzzer. This was an instrument which utilized
the telephone receiver for telegraphic messages. It was a supreme
development for use over defective lines. An instrument closely
related to the buzzer, but which gave even greater secrecy, was
known as the buzzerphone. The buzzerphone was put into production
just before the close of hostilities.</p>

<p>The mobile switchboard in most general use by our troops at the
front was developed originally by the French and was known as the
monotype. It was designed in units and could be extended to
accommodate up to 12 trunk lines leading away from the board.
This apparatus was the "central" of the front-line dugouts. It
could be put into operation in a few minutes and was easily carried
by a soldier.</p>

<p>The switchboard of the dugouts was the only telephone equipment
not of American design used by the American Expeditionary Forces.
It was put into production in the autumn of 1917 in three American
plants, under the general policy of the Signal Corps to contract with
more than one factory for the production of any important device.</p>

<p>Another type of field switchboard when packed for transit resembled
a salesman's trunk. It was used in the camps and provided
for 40 lines. This board was being constantly redesigned as field
needs developed. A new type of camp switchboard was coming into
heavy production at the end of hostilities.</p>

<p>Still a third type of portable switchboard was built in units resembling
the units of a sectional bookcase and was set up in the same way.</p>

<p>The telegraph apparatus of the lines of communication in the
S. O. S. was designed along purely commercial lines. It included
the latest type of printing telegraph equipment, the apparatus first
adopted being the multiplex printing telegraph as used by the
Western Union Telegraph Co. Later, the Morkrum printing telegraph
was also adopted.</p>

<p>At the close of hostilities 133 complete telegraph stations with
full equipment were in operation in the service of supply. The peak
load of this service, just prior to the armistice, was 47,555 telegrams,
averaging 60 words each, sent from these stations in a single day.
The daily average in the final weeks of the fighting was 43,845
telegrams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span></p>


<h4>RADIO.</h4>

<p>At the outbreak of the war, the field radio equipment in active use
by the Army was limited to two sets, both of comparatively high
power. On the other hand the allied forces had developed a complicated
and extensive use of radio sets of small power, many of them
operated from airplanes, and the Signal Corps found itself confronted
with the task of developing an entire new line of complicated electrical
apparatus, and putting it into large quantity production in the
shortest possible time. The progress made is indicated by the fact that
at the signing of the armistice the number of types of complete sets on
which development work had been carried out was 75. Of these
approximately 25 were in quantity production. When it is remembered
that each of these sets consisted of hundreds of parts, many of
which required careful study and experimentation as well as design,
the magnitude of the problem is appreciated.</p>

<p>The initial step in the reorganization of this branch of the Signal
Corps' work consisted in the establishment of a radio section in
Washington and a corresponding section in France. The former was
charged with the design of apparatus and the preparation of manufacturing
drawings and specifications, while the latter served as the
first hand observer of actual service requirements and approved all
equipment before it was used in the field. An important auxiliary
of the development organization in Washington was the radio laboratories
established at Camp Alfred Vail, where all necessary technical
facilities, such as model shops, drafting rooms, research laboratories,
a completely equipped flying field, etc., were maintained. With this
engineering organization and the production organization which
handled all Signal Corps equipment, the work here detailed was
carried out.</p>

<p>Shortly after the declaration of war, the French government sent
to this country a distinguished commission which included the foremost
radio experts, who were thoroughly familiar with the latest
military developments. Technical information and samples of radio
apparatus were also obtained from British sources. With this
beginning, the engineering work naturally divided itself into two
general problems&mdash;first, to duplicate the approved foreign designs,
and then to create designs for new types of apparatus which would
be superior to any in service. Work on these two groups of problems
was prosecuted simultaneously with the result that there were soon
in production American equivalents of a number of French and
British sets, together with improved original types of American
radio apparatus.</p>

<p>Probably the most noteworthy technical development during the
war, in so far as radio communication is concerned, was the extensive
use made of vacuum tubes. These "bottles," which make practical
use of the electrons of the new physics and which are sometimes
called audions or pliotrons, are literally marvels in the realms of
engineering, and their applications are as yet hardly realized. One
form was used for the reception of signals prior to the war; but the
military developments, particularly in France, had so progressed
that when this country entered the war they were used both for
receiving and transmitting signals, and most of the more important
sets depended on them. To meet this demand the services of the
three foremost vacuum-tube engineering organizations of the country
were enlisted, and under the direction of the Signal Corps radio
engineers the progress toward satisfactory design and construction of
the required types was rapid. Within less than six months standardized
tubes were turned out by the quantity production method at
rates sufficient to insure the requisite supply. Work was continued,
however, on the development of still better types of tubes. The
improvements that have been made from time to time have been
incorporated in the tubes being produced on a large scale, so that
tubes of recent manufacture are a great improvement over those
made a year ago.</p>

<p>As indicative of the extent and variety of the radio development
work which was carried on, there is given below a partial list of
the types of sets which were completely developed and placed in
production during the war period:</p>

<p class="center">LAND RADIO EQUIPMENT.

</ul>

<p>The magnitude of the production of special items involved may be
gathered from such figures of expenditures as the following:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="special items">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">For vacuum tubes</td>
    <td>$1,650,600</td>

  </tr>
</table>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></div>

<p>These are, of course, only some of the items. The total production
authorized was valued at approximately $45,000,000.</p>

<p>The remarkable development and improvement of military radio
equipment which has taken place under the direction of the Signal
Corps during the last 18 months will undoubtedly materially change
the system of Army communications and even the tactical use of
military equipment and personnel. A typical example of this development
is the airplane radio telephone, described elsewhere, the use
of which has made possible the "voice-commanded air squadron."
The military value of an air squadron has been enormously increased
by virtue of this device, which enables the squadron commander to
direct the movements of the individual airplanes in any manner
which circumstances may require.</p>

<p>Certain other radio devices recently perfected, the nature of which
can not be revealed, will undoubtedly affect the tactical use of troops
to such an extent as to make certain kinds of radio equipment as
indispensable to the operations of military units as the rifle or the
machine gun.</p>


<h4>LINE EQUIPMENT.</h4>

<p>The first requisition for line equipment for France called for
the construction of 500 miles of telephone and telegraph main
pole lines, carrying 10 copper telephone and telegraph wires. It
was found that ship space could not be spared for poles in
such quantity. Consequently a forestry unit was sent to France
to get these poles from the French woodlands. All of the
other materials for the 500 miles of line, together with materials
for approximately 600 miles of extensions, were procured in the United
States and shipped to France within six months after the requisition
was received. This material was secured in such short time only
by the cooperation of the large commercial companies in the United
States, who literally stripped their warehouses bare of their supplies.</p>

<p>In the late summer of 1918 the American Government began anticipating
the advance of the allied forces into Germany, and the
Signal Corps put into production a reserve equipment for long distance
line approximating 500 miles. Soon there was received from France
a cablegram asking for the shipment of this material, and it was all
floated before the armistice. However, as it turned out, this equipment
was never required, since the terms of the armistice gave the
American forces the German telephone and telegraph lines in the
occupied territory.</p>

<p>This line equipment was all of a type standard in the United States.
For the fighting zone special line equipment was required. Before the
war with Germany American signal troops had set up their emergency
telephone and telegraph lines on the standard "lance poles." These
poles served admirably in open warfare, but proved to be impracti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>cable
for the static conditions of fighting in France. After a considerable
supply of lance poles had been shipped abroad their production
was curtailed. Thereafter the trench telephone and telegraph
lines were supported on short stakes with special cross arms, in
appearance the conventional telegraph poles in miniature. The
enormous mileage of trench lines called for a great quantity of insulators
and cross arms. The wastage of these fittings, due to their
being exposed to artillery fire, became increasingly greater in the
closing months of the war.</p>

<p>In wire itself, the American production was enormous. This production
included the commercial type of copper line wire and the
drop wire for connecting up individual telephones to the pole lines.
Much commercial cable for connecting congested centers with branch
switchboards was also required. Yet all of this wire used in the system
within the Service of Supply was but a small quantity compared
with the requirements in the fighting zone.</p>

<p>The production of double-conductor wire, or the so-called outpost
wire of No Man's Land, which had relegated to the scrap heap the
standard field wire of open warfare, necessitated an extraordinary
effort. The wire had to be light enough for easy transportation and
laying, strong enough to withstand the abrasions from traffic crossing
it as it lay on the ground, and exceedingly well insulated. The first
estimate was that an American Army in the field might use 1,000
miles per month of outpost wire. When the first American force
actually went into action, in the spring of 1918, a reserve supply of
20,000 miles of outpost wire was in the American warehouses in
France, with a vast quantity of cable in reserve. Cable, at first used
in large quantities at the front, was invariably buried several feet
underground and abandoned at every change of headquarters.</p>

<p>As the fighting grew more intense and covered a wider and wider
area, the wastage of outpost wire became enormous. The demand
of our forces for cable dropped to a negligible quantity, but wire
requirements rose. Outpost wire became the main dependence of
ourselves and the allies for all communication in the active sectors.
A higher quality of wire was specified. So great was the destruction
of wire that by July, 1918, the original estimate of 1,000 miles per
month to be supplied by American factories had jumped to 20,000
miles.</p>

<p>As a substitute for outpost wire to fill the immediate needs the
familiar twisted drop wire, with which the ordinary telephone is
connected with the main circuit, was adopted. Our field officers
liked drop wire, its only objectionable feature being its relative bulk.
All available drop wire in the United States was shipped across, and
its manufacture was pushed until the new type of outpost wire could
be produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p>The Signal Corps supplied the mounting needs of the American
Expeditionary Forces through August and September, 1918, with the
available drop wire plus the growing production of the new outpost
wire. In early August all the wire makers in America were summoned
to a conference, in which the Signal Corps made known the
necessity of pushing production. The result was an expansion which
reached a total production of 40,000 miles of outpost wire in November.</p>

<p>Just before the armistice was signed, the American Expeditionary
Forces indicated that they would require 50,000 miles of outpost wire
every month, beginning in January, 1919. This requirement had
already been fully anticipated, since the American manufacturers
had set for themselves a maximum production of 68,000 miles per
month by August, 1919.</p>

<p>To secure this production every wire mill in the United States
worked 24 hours per day. When the production was at its height,
inquiries came from the allied governments, indicating that they
would call on American wire makers for a quantity of wire equal to
what the latter were already producing for the American Expeditionary
Forces. In other words, this proposition called for the doubling of a
production which had already attained great size. Yet, had the
fighting continued, there is every reason to believe that the industry
would have risen to the demand.</p>

<p>The production of outpost wire was an intricate operation. To fill
the demand for 50,000 miles of outpost wire a month called for 300,000
miles of steel strand and 400,000 miles of bronze strand every month.
The steel strand had to be given repeated heat treatments before it
had acquired the necessary tensile strength.</p>


<h4>ELECTRIC BATTERIES.</h4>

<p>The American Expeditionary Forces consumed great quantities
of electric batteries, the familiar dry battery of commerce being
most used. Toward the end of the fighting arrangements were being
made to establish in France a plant at which dry batteries would be
assembled by French labor, utilizing parts made in America. The
necessary apparatus and materials for the first operation had reached
France prior to the armistice, but the plant was not in production at
that time.</p>

<p>Storage-battery requirements of the American Expeditionary
Forces were heavy and exacting. The storage battery was the only
practicable source of electrical energy for the operation of small
portable radio outfits. Field conditions required a storage battery
that would not spill its contents, with a jar not easily broken, the
whole equipment being as light as possible. A rubber composition
jar was finally adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief reliance of the American Expeditionary Forces was in
storage batteries of European manufacture, which were to be used
until American production got underway. When by the summer of
1918 America had perfected her own designs of radio equipment, the
Signal Corps took up the matter of storage batteries for radio and
decided upon types. This was in July, 1918. A conference of battery
manufacturers was called and the orders were allocated among
practically all the storage-battery plants in the United States that
were in a position to undertake quantity production. The end of
hostilities stopped this production on the eve of heavy deliveries.</p>


<h4>FIELD GLASSES.</h4>

<p>When the war began, the Signal Corps had the duty of providing
field glasses for all branches of the Army, issuing them to noncommissioned
officers and selling them at cost to commissioned officers
engaged in combat. The first estimates showed that these glasses
would be needed by the tens of thousands, whereas the manufacturing
facilities in the United States had turned them out merely by the
hundreds.</p>

<p>The optical-glass industry had never been developed in America,
our field glasses being supplied with lenses of European glass, and
principally German glass. In 1914 the imports of optical glass were
$641,000 in value. The following year they were almost nothing.
The advance of the German army toward Paris encompassed the glass
plants of Belgium and many of those of France. England needed
the entire output of her own glass factories.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1914 the American optical-instrument makers
began to develop an optical-glass industry, largely stimulated by the
possibility of obtaining heavy orders at high prices from the British,
French, and Russian governments. The most important work was
done by the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., of Rochester, N. Y.; the
Spencer Lens Co., of Buffalo, and the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., of
Pittsburgh. They were aided by the United States Bureau of
Standards and by the geophysical laboratory of the Carnegie Institution.
The Bureau of Standards established a laboratory at Pittsburgh
where experiments were conducted with 30-pound pots of
glass.</p>

<p>Optical glass differs greatly from ordinary glass. It must be clear,
without striae, and there must be no strains in it, resulting from the
final stirring and cooling. It must give a high transmission of light.</p>

<p>About the time of America's declaration of war the American
experiments had produced glass suitable for optical instruments.
This glass, however, was being turned out in quantities quite insufficient
to meet the demand during the first few months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the difficulties surrounding the glass supply, there
was only a limited number of establishments capable of manufacturing
field glasses after the glass was procured. These concerns were
located principally in Rochester, N. Y., where they had been manufacturing
a wide variety of optical instruments, including opera glasses,
camera lenses, scientific and educational apparatus, battery commanders'
telescopes, marine glasses, microscopes, and gun sights. In
order to meet the war requirements of America for field glasses, these
factories had to install large quantities of new equipment and to run
day and night. The equipment consisted of lens-grinding apparatus,
lathes, dies, and automatic screw machinery.</p>

<p>In addition to the Rochester factories there was a concern in
Denver, Colo., the Weiss Electrical Instruments Co., which in a
smaller way had been manufacturing surveyors' levels and other
engineering apparatus. The Talbot Reel &amp; Manufacturing Co., of
Kansas City, had been making fishing reels in a small plant about 30
feet square. This factory was purchased in 1917 by Mr. L. Harris,
who, after finishing a contract for gun sights for the Ordnance
Department, built a factory especially for the production of Army
field glasses and reached the quantity manufacture of these instruments
before the armistice came. The chief center of supply, however,
continued to be Rochester, where the plants of Bausch &amp; Lomb,
the Gundlach-Manhattan Optical Co., and the Crown Optical Co. are
located. These factories expanded many times, and the output of
field glasses went beyond what the executives at the outset of the
enterprise imagined could be possible.</p>

<p>The Bausch &amp; Lomb Co. was started in Rochester about 50 years
ago by J. J. Bausch, who was born in Germany. The plant developed
gradually, making a full line of spectacle lenses and optical
instruments. The Carl Zeiss Works, of Jena, Germany, had a
financial interest in the plant, and Bausch &amp; Lomb had a financial
interest in the Zeiss plant. This connection, however, was dissolved
in 1915, when Bausch &amp; Lomb took on contracts for the manufacture
of field glasses for the British, French, and Russian governments.</p>

<p>Before 1914 this concern had never manufactured more than 1,800
pairs of field glasses in a year. The output was speeded up until in
November, 1918, a total of 3,500 pairs was being produced each week,
while the development was aiming toward an output of 5,500 pairs
of glasses per week beginning in January, 1919. At the date of the
armistice the Bausch &amp; Lomb factory had a floor space of 32 acres
and employed 6,000 men and women.</p>

<p>The Gundlach-Manhattan Co., which had made camera lenses
chiefly, was eventually able to produce 600 pairs of field glasses a
week. The Crown Optical Co. was not so rapid in its expansion; and
in late 1917 the Navy Department commandeered it and thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
operated it in charge of Lieut. Commander L. C. Scheibla. Under
naval management the output of this factory increased so that the
Signal Corps was able to obtain from it about 1,200 pairs of high
quality field glasses each week, the plant continuing also to supply
the needs of the Navy.</p>

<p>Out of a situation that seemed impossible at the outset the Signal
Corps built up an industry within a comparatively few months which
provided all the field glasses that were necessary in the operations of
the American Expeditionary Forces. Often to keep the optical factories
equipped with sufficient workmen the Signal Corps obtained
the furlough of drafted men with experience in this line so that they
might go to work making field glasses.</p>

<p>All Army organizations except Artillery were supplied with a six-power
glass having an angular field that took in a view 150 yards
wide at a distance of 1,000 yards. The glasses were of the prismatic
type with individual focus for each eye. Each glass was provided
with a leather carrying case and shoulder strap. On the top of the
case a compass was mounted.</p>

<p>The Artillery organizations were supplied with eight-power field
glasses, all of which were purchased in France.</p>

<p>The total requirements of the American Expeditionary Forces for
field glasses of the six-power type during the period of hostilities were
approximately 100,000 pairs. The total shipments from America
were approximately 106,000 pairs.</p>


<h4>MISCELLANEOUS SUPPLIES.</h4>

<p>The Signal Corps took up with three concerns&mdash;the Hampden
Watch Co., the Illinois Watch Co., and the Elgin Watch Co.&mdash;the
matter of providing wrist watches for the Army. A 7-jewel movement
was adopted as standard for issue to troops and a 15-jewel
movement for sale to officers. A waterproof case was adopted, bearing
the serial number of the movement on the outside, the case being
so constructed as to require a special tool to gain access to the movement.</p>

<p>The production of wire carts for the Signal Corps did not exceed 25
per year prior to 1917. The demand for these carts, which were hard
to build, increased at such a rate that during the autumn of 1918 the
matter of procuring them was one of the most serious production
problems faced by the Signal Corps.</p>

<p>The Holmes Automobile Co., of Canton, Ohio, abandoned the production
of automobiles and in September, 1918, turned over its entire
plant to the production of wire carts. Other manufacturers were the
George B. Marx Co., of Brooklyn; the J. G. Brill Co., of Philadelphia;
the American Instrument &amp; Tool Co., of New York; and the Wesel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
Manufacturing Co., of Brooklyn. In all, 721 wire carts were manufactured
and 327 shipped overseas.</p>

<p>A total of 2,402 tool chests for the Signal Corps was produced during
the war period. The plan eventually adopted was to split up the
orders for tools among the various manufacturers and to give the
manufacture of the empty chests to prison labor at Fort Leavenworth,
where the tools were to be shipped and packed in the chests.
This plan, however, required the construction of a special building at
Fort Leavenworth, and in the meantime the assembling of tool chests
was conducted at the Signal Corps supply depot at Philadelphia and
at the port of embarkation. The armistice stopped the construction
of the assembling factory at Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps produced a suitable number of gas alarm signals
known as strombos horns. This equipment consisted of an alarm
horn operated by air pressure acting against a diaphragm and thereby
producing a loud and distinct chatter. Compressed air was supplied
in small steel cylinders connected to each horn by hose. The air
tanks were charged behind the lines from a portable air compressor
which could pump into several cylinders at once. The horns were
manufactured by the Klaxon Co., of Newark, N. J., the cylinders by
the Harrisburg Pipe &amp; Pipe Bending Co., Harrisburg, Pa., and the
air compressors by the Ingersoll-Rand Co., of New York.</p>

<p>Flag kits were not used to any great extent by the American Expeditionary
Forces, although large quantities of these were produced
in this country.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps originally had jurisdiction over all war photography,
either of land or air, except for a small amount conducted by
the engineers in connection with their own operations; but later
aerial photography became a branch of the Military Aeronautics and
Aircraft Bureaus. After that the Signal Corps was charged with
taking all photographs of historical nature or other interest.</p>

<p>In connection with this work two types of cameras were necessary&mdash;still
cameras and motion-picture cameras. Later in the war there
was being developed a new motion-picture camera which was expected
to be the ideal type for use in the field.</p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that a sufficient number of photographic
lenses was obtained for the use of military cameras, since the large
lens factories of America were tied up with other war orders. A campaign
was conducted by the leading newspapers and magazines of the
country which resulted in the Government's securing from amateur
photographers a large number of high-grade lenses, mostly of foreign
manufacture.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps scattered its camera operators broadcast over the
country, photographing cantonments and other war activities to the
most minute details. These photographs and films were then made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
public in newspapers, periodicals, and motion-picture theaters
throughout the United States, with the result that the people saw
with their own eyes how their soldiers were preparing themselves for
the defense of the Nation.</p>

<p>An interesting development of war photography was the production
of motion pictures showing the training of soldiers. Many
pictures were taken to show graphically on the screen the different
chapters of the Army drill regulations. These pictures will have a
future use to the Government in training soldiers efficiently in the
shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The Signal Corps photographers also developed a new kind of history
of the war, a history written entirely in pictures for future generations
to scan.</p>


<h4>PIGEONS.</h4>

<p>Although nearly every European army for 40 years has trained
the carrier pigeon to be a field messenger, the American Army never
adopted the bird until 1917. In a single year the Signal Corps established
hundreds of pigeon lofts in this country and overseas and
bought and trained more than 15,000 pigeons for service in France.
In actual use on the field the pigeons delivered more than 95 per cent
of the messages intrusted to them, flying safely through the heaviest
shell and gas barrages.</p>

<p>The standard pigeon loft adopted by the Signal Corps had a unique
trap arrangement which permitted the entry but not the exit of returning
pigeons, and an electrical alarm which automatically notified
the attendants of an arrival. Such lofts, however, were of the
stationary type and not practicable for use in France. For the
American Expeditionary Forces the Signal Corps purchased mobile
lofts. It was found that pigeons would come home as well to mobile
lofts, which were constantly changing position, as they would to
stationary lofts. The first mobile lofts built in the United States
were top-heavy, but this defect was overcome by increasing their
width and adding heavier wheels. They were all built by the Trailmobile
Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>

<p>Civilian pigeon fanciers were appealed to and urged to breed young
birds to stock the Government lofts. The Signal Corps distributed
small aluminum bands to be put on the legs of squeakers, as the newly-hatched
pigeons are called, which were intended for sale to the
Government. The uniform price of $2 per bird was paid, and over
10,000 youngsters were bought for stocking purposes.</p>

<p>Tons of pigeon feed were purchased and shipped to Europe. Some
of this grain, such as millet, Argentine corn, pop corn, hemp seed,
and Canada peas, was hard to obtain; but nevertheless the supply
was well maintained. It was shipped in hermetically sealed containers
to prevent it from becoming mildewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span></p>

<p>The American Army copied the French and English models of
willow and reed baskets to hold the birds. One type of basket was
carried on the back of the soldier and contained small corselets in
which the pigeons were securely fastened. Corselets were suspended
from the sides of the basket by elastic contrivances permitting considerable
joggling without injury to the birds. All of these baskets
were made by the A. L. Randell Co., of Chicago.</p>

<p>Message books were manufactured in accordance with a French
model. After the message had been written, it was placed in an
aluminum capsule which was fitted in a holder of aluminum. This
holder was attached to the pigeon's leg by means of aluminum bands.
These bands were found to break easily, and pure copper bands were
later substituted. The message holders were manufactured by
Thomas A. Gey, of Norristown, Pa.</p>

<p>Thousands of items of supply were included in the supply schedules
of the Signal Corps. In the following lists some of the more important
items are shown, the production indicated in each case being that
between April 6, 1917, and November 11, 1918.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>The reader who has come to this point has before him the picture
of the Nation's industry at war&mdash;the whole teeming effort in its main
outlines, its myriad ramifications, its boundless activity, its ten
thousand enterprises, its infinite toil, its hosts of workers, its wonders
of scientific achievement, its attainments, even its failures&mdash;in short
that humming complex of work, planning, ambition, disappointment,
triumph, shortcomings, ability, and driving force which was a mighty
people concentrated with all of its powers upon a single objective.</p>

<p>It remains now to describe the place occupied by this effort in the
whole strategic plan of the war against Germany. We did not go
into the struggle as if we expected to fight a single-handed war.
Whatever we did either with military personnel or with munitions
we did with reference to what the nations associated with us were
doing or could do in the same respects. The whole plan was coordinated
more or less perfectly, and these international understandings
and agreements touched and influenced even the most trivial of our
enterprises.</p>

<p>The reader who has in mind the record set down on the preceding
pages is now prepared to comprehend the force and extent of the
international cooperation in the war and to judge how well America
played her part in the general scheme. Let us go back, therefore,
and review the history of these agreements.</p>

<p>For many months before America came into the struggle,
England, France, and Italy had been engaged in grappling with
the scientifically organized forces of German military autocracy.
The world war had become a conflict of materials, almost as much
as of men. All participants had mobilized their industrial resources
in a manner and to an extent undreamed of in times of peace.</p>

<p>The allies had marshaled all available raw materials and factory
production in their own lands, and still faced colossal deficiencies in
supplies for their military programs. They had been forced to reach
out into the markets of the world to meet these deficiencies. They
had come to America and placed huge orders for raw materials and
finished products. The normal capacity of America's peace-time
production had been insufficient to meet their overwhelming needs.</p>

<p>In August, 1914, the total factory capacity in the United States
for the manufacture of powder was 6,000,000 pounds a year. In
April, 1917, under the stimulation of orders placed by the allies, the
capacity had been increased more than sixty-fold. England, France,
and Italy were taking this entire production and asking for more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
They had absorbed our entire output. A huge stream of materials,
supplies, and ammunition was flowing steadily from America to the
front line trenches in France. The allied governments had moulded
their military programs in reliance upon the continuation of this
source of supply. Their troops were on the front and in contact
with the enemy. Failure of supply meant disaster.</p>

<p>The flow of materials from America to the armies in France could
not, under any circumstances, be interfered with or curtailed. This
fact was promptly recognized by the United States, and the allied
governments were assured that America's military program would be
formulated and performed without interference with the allied programs
of supply from this country.</p>

<p>America's industrial contribution to the war, as a nation, was to be
over and above the industrial contribution to the allies then being
made by our individual producers. This fundamental plank in the
interallied platform of cooperation was laid down at the very commencement
of America's preparation, and it was strictly adhered to
until the end of hostilities.</p>

<p>A comprehensive cooperative plan for America's industrial participation
in the war remained to be worked out. A survey had to be
conducted of the new partner's strength and weakness in supply. A
determination had to be made of what the allies could give to the
new partner, and what they must receive from her. This was done
by the Interallied Munitions Council sitting in Paris, by the foreign
missions in Washington in conference with the War Department, and
by the allied war ministries and Gen. Pershing abroad.</p>

<p>An analysis of the facts of the situation disclosed that:</p>

<p>A. The world over&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) There was a critical shortage of ocean tonnage which promised
to become more critical as time passed on account of the success of
German submarine operations.</p>

<p>B. In France and England&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The output of factories was being seriously curtailed and
limited by lack of raw materials and semifinished products.</p>

<p>(2) If an adequate supply of raw materials and semifinished
products could be made available, the factories had a substantial
surplus manufacturing capacity which could be placed at the disposal
of the United States.</p>

<p>C. In the United States&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A surplus of raw materials and semifinished products for transport
to France and England could quickly be made available.</p>

<p>(2) It would be impossible, within less than a year, to build up
additional manufacturing capacity in the United States sufficient
to supply a large army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p>The lack of ocean tonnage was recognized by all as the vitals of
the problem. France, Italy, and the United States had comparatively
little merchant tonnage. England's vast tonnage was suffering
rapid depletion by submarine losses and was totally inadequate
to meet allied needs. Ships were the biggest single deficiency in the
interallied program.</p>

<p>The cooperative industrial program of the Allies and the United
States had to be geared into the shipping problem. To do this the
determination of what materials should be shipped from the United
States had to be decided first on the basis of what economies could be
effected in shipping space. If raw materials for aircraft occupied less
cargo space than the finished product, the maximum utilization of
available tonnage demanded the shipment to France of these raw
materials to be made into the finished product there. If, on the other
hand, finished nitrocellulose powder for artillery shell propellants, or
finished picric acid for artillery shell explosives, occupied less cargo
space than the raw component materials used in their production, the
shipping shortage demanded manufacture of these explosives and
propellants in the United States. Not a single ship could be freighted
with an extra pound or cubic foot of cargo which by any effort could
be saved.</p>

<p>The French Mission in the United States early recognized this fact
and urged the manufacture in the United States of picric acid to be
used as explosive in 75-millimeter and 155-millimeter shell, pointing
out that the finished product occupied but one-nineteenth as much
cargo space as the raw materials.</p>

<p>Gen. Pershing recognized the point, and in August, 1917, cabled as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A joint French-American commission has examined the question of the production
in France of powders and explosives and reports as follows: France must import by
December 4 the greater part of the raw materials used in the manufacture of powders
and explosives. The weight of raw materials required is 10 to 20 times the weight
of the finished product. The shipping situation is such that by December the output
of France will be limited by the amount of raw material produced in France or easily
obtainable. * * * The present outlook is that in December the French output
will not be more than half of the present output. To avoid calamity the United States
must not only furnish powder and explosives for all of its own forces but must supply
about half of the French requirements. It is therefore recommended: (A) that the
United States Government furnish all powders and explosives needed for present
contracts with French Government; (B) that the United States Government prepare
to furnish by December 300 tons per month of explosives and 200 tons per month of
powder for French consumption; (C) that study be immediately commenced for the
purpose of adapting American powders to French cannon of different types, this
study to be made both in the United States and in France by competent experts;
(D) that the French Government put at the disposition of the American Government
competent experts both in the manufacture and use of these powders in the guns. * * *</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequent computations made on this side of the ocean indicated
that in the case of picric acid and other explosives this ratio between
raw materials and finished product in bulk was too great, yet in principle
these computations did not affect the desirability of shipping
the finished product rather than the raw materials.</p>

<p>Again, Gen. Pershing cabled to the Chief of Staff in the United
States urging the purchase of completed artillery, artillery ammunition,
and airplanes abroad, in order that "saving of tonnage"
might be effected, and pointing out the saving of cargo space resulting
from the shipment to France of raw materials instead of finished
products, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Following is comparison in tonnage of the principal manufactured articles of
ordnance obtained in Europe and the replacements in raw materials contracted for
the same. All tonnage ratios shown are in favor of raw materials:</p></div>

<p>In the above comparison in the ammunition item, finished explosives
are regarded as raw materials.</p>

<p>The Interallied Munitions Council, sitting in Paris and containing
among its membership the best military and industrial brains at the
command of the allied cause, including Gen. Pershing, Gen. Robertson,
chief of the imperial general staff of Great Britain, and Gen.
Foch, then chief of the general staff of the French Army, came to
the same conclusion, and Gen. Bliss transmitted its findings in a
memorable cable, a part of which was reproduced in the preface to
this report.</p>

<p>Every mind was in accord. Tonnage must be saved. It could be
saved and in vast amounts by calling upon the United States to
supply the raw and semifinished materials, and upon the French and
British war factories to utilize these raw and semifinished materials
in the manufacture of the finished products.</p>

<p>But could this solution of the vital shipping question be dovetailed
into the industrial situations of the various nations concerned?
Could the United States supply the essential raw and semifinished
materials in quantities equivalent to the amounts consumed in the
manufacture of the finished product? Did the French and British
factories, with these materials laid down in their yards, have available
a sufficient manufacturing surplus to supply the needs of their
own armies and also to produce in part for the armies of America?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p>The foreign missions were in Washington. They knew intimately
the economic and industrial situations in their respective countries;
they knew the military plans of their general staffs; they knew in
what respects their programs of supply for their armies in the field
needed assistance, and in what respects these programs could be
met or exceeded. With this information available, they were prepared
to furnish the answer as to the manufacturing capacities of
allied Europe.</p>

<p>The British War Mission in Washington communicated to the
War Department a cable from the British minister of armament,
setting out the position of the British Government on reciprocal
supply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The British Government is willing as far as possible in matters of urgency to manufacture
for use of the Americans any products necessary to the more speedy equipment
of the Americans that the Americans consider they can obtain in England more
promptly or better than in the United States. Furthermore, the situation as to
manufacture of steel products is better than it has been. The British Government
will help to its utmost ability without making actual and immediate replacement of
raw material an indispensable condition when any order is given. On the other hand
the general principle of replacements of raw materials as soon as possible should be
observed. It has become more a question of furnishing supplies promptly to the
allies than a mere question of replacing what has been furnished American troops; in
other words, the needs of the allies should be considered as one, and England should
manufacture for the allies anything that is necessary or best got that way, and America
should in the general interest of the allies furnish as soon as convenient raw material
to replace that used. * * *</p></div>

<p>Writing to Maj. Gen. Crozier, Chief of Ordnance, the French high
commission urged the placement in France of orders for artillery and
artillery ammunition and pointed out the existence of surplus factory
capacity available for their production. The commission summarized
the industrial situation in France in the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even in such remarkable technical conditions as yours, it takes time to realize such
a program, to organize manufactures and to have men to direct them. You will take
less time than we did in France, where the output of big guns was not adequate to our
needs before the end of 1916. But time&mdash;more or less&mdash;had to be an essential factor,
so that after careful consideration, it has been found that the only plan to be carried
out in order to supply the first American divisions with material on their landing in
France was to avail ourselves of the surplus capacity of production of the French
factories, which had been since the beginning of the war very powerfully equipped
and were able to turn out greater quantities than those corresponding to our supply of
raw material.</p></div>

<p>The allies could deliver the artillery, artillery ammunition, and
airplanes if America could deliver the raw and semifinished materials.
America answered that she could and would produce and transport
to Europe raw materials and semifinished products in amounts
equivalent to the amounts consumed by allied factories in manufacturing
the completed guns, shell, and airplanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p>The details remained to be worked out. The French high commission
submitted statements showing the amounts of each component
material consumed in French factories in the production of guns and
ammunition of the various calibers. There were to be supplied by
America 6 tons of steel for each 75-millimeter gun, 40 tons of steel
for each 155-millimeter howitzer, and 60 tons of steel for each 155-millimeter
gun, and proper proportionate amounts of necessary materials
used in the manufacture of artillery ammunition.</p>

<p>The program of industrial and economic cooperation between the
United States and the allies thus took form. It used in the most
efficient manner every nook and cranny of every available ship. It
utilized to the utmost the surplus manufacturing capacity of France
and England. It brought into the war at the earliest moment the
resources of America in raw and semifinished materials. It spanned
the period during which America could go forward with her gigantic
mobilization of manufacturing power and later convince the Central
Empires of the futility of further struggle.</p>

<p>With the program mapped out, reciprocal agreements for supply
remained to be made. Orders were promptly placed.</p>

<p>The United States ordered from France a total of 5,854 pieces of
field and trench artillery of various calibers, of which 3,834 were
delivered to the American Expeditionary Forces prior to the armistice.</p>

<p>By August, 1917, more artillery ammunition was on order with the
French Government than was fired by the American Expeditionary
Forces from January 18, 1918, when the first complete American
division entered the line, until November 11, 1918, when the end of
hostilities was announced to the world. Of the amount ordered
10,000,000 rounds were delivered before firing ceased.</p>

<p>In aircraft equipment, the French factories also had a surplus
capacity and delivered to Gen. Pershing up to November 11, 1918,
a total of 4,881 finished airplanes.</p>

<p>By the terms of our agreement with the French Government,
America obligated herself to supply the raw materials and component
parts of the finished products delivered to our forces in France.
This agreement America performed twice over. For every ton of
raw materials and semifinished products America agreed to furnish to
France, she furnished two tons. According to French statements,
our replacement obligation in raw materials was 350,000 tons.
America furnished over 800,000 tons.</p>

<p>In exchange for the artillery and artillery ammunition of French
manufacture fired by Pershing, America supplied to France in
metals alone over 700,000 tons of steel, 30,000 tons of pig iron, 5,000
tons of brass and spelter, and 50,000 tons of copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition, and for use in the artillery ammunition received from
French factories, America manufactured and supplied to France in a
finished state all the principal materials used in loading all shell
delivered to the American Army. These materials consisted of
smokeless powder, used as a propellant to drive the shell from the
guns, and of picric acid, used as a high-powered detonative to burst
over the enemy lines. The French used 12,000 tons of smokeless
powder in our shell. America delivered an equivalent amount of
finished powder. The French consumed 18,000 tons of picric acid in
loading shell for American use. America supplied 18,500 tons.</p>

<p>In exchange for the finished airplanes, again America supplied the
raw materials and component parts. For the framework of the
French planes driven by American aviators, America furnished
34,500,000 feet of spruce, fir, and cedar, enough to manufacture over
16,000 finished planes; for the propellors, America furnished 7,000,000
feet of mahogany and walnut, enough for 40,000 propellors; 4,000
tons of aluminum, enough for thousands of planes; and dopes for
painting airplane wings, and miscellaneous aircraft materials and
supplies far in excess of the number of finished planes delivered to
Gen. Pershing. Under special contract made in August, 1917, and in
addition to the above, America furnished to France all materials for
5,000 finished planes and all parts for 8,500 finished airplane engines,
which were to be assembled in France for the American Expeditionary
Forces. The engine parts were in forgings and needed only to be
machined. For the use of the French Government in machining these
engine parts, America built and delivered the necessary equipment
and machinery.</p>

<p>Thousands of additional smaller items of all kinds were supplied
by the various governments to each other from day to day. No
deficiency in the military programs of any of them was permitted to
exist, if it could be made good by any of the others.</p>

<p>All of America's vast contribution to the allied program of supply
was not only produced in America, but it was taken to France in
army transports. From August, 1917, to November 11, 1918, an
average of 2,000 tons of American materials for French factories
left American ports every day aboard American army transports.
Through a submarine-infested ocean, in which the Germans sank
over 21,000,000 tons of dead-weight shipping, these materials were
carried in army transports manned by American crews, and laid
down at the doors of French factories.</p>

<p>By February, 1918, Gen. Pershing estimated that 2,000,000 tons
of cargo space had been saved by the adoption of this program of
international and reciprocal supply, a saving of more tonnage than
was then available for the use of the American Expeditionary Forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
The Franco-American commission on explosives estimated a reduction
of 75 per cent in cargo space in the shipment of explosives alone.</p>

<p>So the silent drama of international cooperation was carried out.
The story of British and American mutual aid during the war is
the same story in substance as that of Franco-American cooperation,
with changes only in the figures. Economy of shipping was effected.
British and French factory capacity was utilized. The vast reservoir
of American raw materials and explosives was thrown against the
enemy. International cooperation on a scale and in a spirit of cordial,
mutual helpfulness, such as the world had never dreamed of, helped
to equip 2,000,000 American soldiers in France.</p>

<p>And it was done, all of it, without curtailment of the huge stream of
material which was flowing from America to the allies when the
United States entered the war. France and England received ever-increasing
quantities to the last day. The more than 800,000 tons
of replacement materials for artillery, artillery ammunition, and airplanes
delivered to America was over and above the millions of tons
secured by the allies for their own use directly from American producers.</p>

<p>It was partly by reason of the adoption of this program and its
complete performance that Gen. Pershing, after the armistice, could
say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During active operations extending from January, 1918, when our first division
entered the line, until the close of hostilities on November 11, our troops were
supplied with the equipment and ammunition necessary to carry their work to a
successful conclusion.</p></div>

<p>Beyond all this, our Government, as part of the interallied program,
created vast faculties for the manufacture of supplies which England,
France, and Italy still required for their own needs and which a
comprehensive consideration of the entire program, with particular
reference to shipping, showed could be best produced in this country.
Factories for the production of immense additional quantities of
picric acid, powder, and other materials were built by our War Department
to fill the deficiencies in the military programs of our associates
in the war.</p>

<p>And beyond and behind all this America went forward with her
own gigantic preparations for the conquest of the dark forces which
threatened world civilization. It was this mobilization of her might
almost as much as the effect of her immediate force which helped to
convince the German general staff of the futility of further resistance
and assisted to bring the war to an early end.</p>
